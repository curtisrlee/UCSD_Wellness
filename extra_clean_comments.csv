['hey guys it s story time or venting time rather i m not asking for advice or input or anything like that in this post i just wanted to vent and air some thoughts and feelings that have been on my mind for a fair whilea couple of weeks ago i decided to more or less permanently leave an org i was in the first one i had ever joinedback in september i made the decision to join this org over intergenerational connections because it fit into my schedule anyone reading this who is in intergenerational connections let me say that i look forward to being a part of your org fall of next year i attended their informational session and was struck by how much the org s work aligned with my personal interests i was also struck by how everyone made me feel so welcome and at home they were a very charismatic and warm hearted bunch of people i committed myself to the org and began to attend their meetings regularlybefore we go further allow me to make one clarification while the org did have a formal hierarchical structure with a club president and her vice presidents and director generals and so on it was de facto led by two people as in they did the visible day to day running of the org whom i will henceforth refer to as j and s for junior and senior they held the same position in the org s leadership but one was the senior partner and one was the less experienced junior partner along with their associates all of whom are very close friends with one another s was away on business across the country for fall quarter but returned in january hence for all of fall quarter j ran the show alongside the org s de jure leadership my first quarter in the org were my happiest times there we were taught the basic functions of the org and got together for some socials my relationship with the org s leadership was also quite positive during this time when i injured myself and wasn t able to attend org meetings for a couple of weeks i emailed j telling her what had happened and she responded by saying that she totally understood and that i m welcome back whenever i recover a couple of weeks later she spontaneously emailed me again checking in on my progress and to see how i was recovering i was truly touched by the care and sincerity she showed me after my first meeting following my recovery i explicitly told her in person that and expressed my appreciation to her she stated that she and s worked hard over the previous year to make the org more inclusive and less elitist by interacting more with all org members new and old at the end of year social we had a week or so later she hugged me before i left and said to me i m so glad that you re back with all of us i was again touched by her remarks then winter quarter came and that s when things began to go pear shaped s returned from her business away from ucsd and she properly introduced herself to the lot of us at the first meeting of the quarter then j a couple of other new org members and i went away to attend a work function for a couple of days during our time away i felt that j was becoming increasingly tense and distant around me when we returned i asked her through messenger if something was wrong with the intent to repair any damage there may be between us she replied with a very lengthy text that essentially accused me of disrespecting her leadership and s for reasons unbeknownst to me she didn t attend the work function with us as well as of being sexist without providing a shred of justification for either claim i was absolutely speechless i had no clue what she was talking about i always always make sure to treat everybody irrespective of sex with respect and dignity i always make sure to treat my superiors with the appropriate level of respect as well i replayed the entire time we were at the work function and could not think of one instance where i had treated her with anything less than absolute respect i asked people close to me people who i know would not lie to me and would give me the honest truth if i was sexist the result was a resounding and unanimous no being accused point blank of such terrible things infuriated me to no end it hurt me deeply and i felt as if i had been betrayed i thought about asking her to justify why she felt the way she did and trying to see if we could work it out but then concluded that any attempt to talk to someone who d so easily accuse another person of such horrible things would bear no fruit and that i d just be wasting my time by trying to reason with her should i have attempted to talk to her in retrospect perhaps but in all honesty i didn t feel the need or desire to have to negotiate with someone like that nor do i now i and a couple of my friends came to the conclusion that her lashing out at me as she did was the manifestation of some massive insecurity she felt as a result of struggles in her personal life that she had detailed to us at one of our socials as well as that outing being the first outing where she s led the team without the help of other org leaders or the guidance of s from that day on i ve spoken less than words to j i simply refuse to even talk to people with that kind of mentality they re not worth my time and energymy experience with the org only declined from there on out i slowly came to the realization that i couldn t commit nearly as much time to it as they would like me to commit and consequently chose not to go on anymore work outings with them my relationship with the org leadership also slowly dissipated socials stopped being as fun as they used to be they mostly consisted of all the senior org people j and s included and their close friends who used to be in the org clumped together in one area and then all of the new people in another shut out from the former group and forced to conserve amongst themselves the synergy and commingling between old and new members that existed in the fall was well and truly dead at this point i understood that the elitism j said her and s had worked to dismantle hadn t gone away at all they had simply supplanted the old order with their new order they became the very thing they swore to destroy any nerds out there i think i have made my case for my disappointment with j s lack of leadership skills or people skills for that matter quite evident already i had hoped that with s s return the org would become more united than ever before she is from what i could tell a strong and determined and caring person she told us at the first meeting after she returned that she cared for each and every one of us and that she looked forward to getting to know us better over the course of the year despite this promising beginning however her leadership left much to be desired indeed the rest of the org s leadership left much to be desired they claim that they re committed to unifying all of us and getting to know us as individuals yet their actions don t reflect those words they without fail chose to not blend with the new members whenever the opportunity presented itself they subconsciously excluded all of us from their circle and consequently established an elitist hierarchy of sorts within the org where there was a small privileged group at the top and everyone else at the bottom and there is apparently no opportunity for upward mobility no chance of fraternizing or building bonds with the senior members of our org in essence their hearts seemed to be in the right place but their actions did not reflect their verbal commitments they didn t try in my mind anywhere near hard enough to reach out to us and get to know us they could have and should have done better even when taking into account their busy academic lives and their personal lives as well so for these reasons as well as for the reason of me not clicking with a majority of the people in the org old and new which is perfectly fine and natural i decided to leave the org i would have left in early february if it wasn t for personal reasons and commitments that obligated me to stay until early may i suppose my departure is a bittersweet experience for me bitter because of all the resentment and disappointment that has stemmed from this experience sweet because i finally did leave and at least now i know what it s like to be in that orgoh good god that was a long rant but it felt good to get all of that out of my

['i sense that a number of people in this group want to move the community away from facebook out of understandable fears of this new page getting zucced again and or out of the belief that the new confessions are bland and boring i personally don t see how these confessions are dull nor do i know what the hell these people are looking for in these posts whatever the fuck this spice they talk about refers to in fact i think they re as good as the old ones on near its demise if not better since they re now curated for quality if we move away from facebook the whole community will suffer there isn t a shred of doubt in my mind about that most people aren t going to go with the dedicated confessions webpage and then regularly check it for new posts a big reason for this community s success as well as the original page which i wasn t a part of and along with similar ones at berkeley and irvine is primarily because it is on facebook an ungodly number of people on this campus use facebook to some extent or another and thus it is easy for us to keep up with the page and offer advice and insight and gifs and whatnot in response to posts on it it is also easy for new people to join and contribute since they did not need to go to a separate website and make a new account to comment it also makes the pages quite visible and easy to find which also makes it easy for us to increase membership size if this community wasn t on facebook i probably would have never found out about it and my life would ve been less colorful as a resultmoving away from facebook simply inexplicable in my view it is utterly irrational and indefensible simply put it would be the end of this community as we know it if we abandon facebook and i promise you nothing will ever be the same againi fuckin love this page and this group of people and i love how we now have a space where we can vent and express ourselves and ask for get help without shame or fear it s help me plenty as well as allowed me to give aid and comfort to others in need and i m sure it s helped plenty of others too i love all of the love and respect and camaraderie we have with one another it d be a real goddamn shame if it were to suddenly go awayhow about this if you want spice in the community so bad how about we adopt the idea put forth by the admins can create a separate webpage they said they were thinking about but instead of shifting our operations unto that new page and just putting highlights from that page on the facebook page we keep facebook as our main base of operations and simply put highlights and submissions that could potentially violate facebook s rules which i assume are the spicy confessions on that page in essence have the separate confessions webpage serve as a complement to the main facebook page and help it avoid getting zucced again also implement the separate google form for complaints about posts and comments that are deemed offensive or inflammatory or in poor taste or whatever and then advertise the shit out of that form to ensure that old members and new members alike know where to go when they want to report something if berkeley and irvine can manage to keep their respective communities thriving with these structures and i think more draconian rules and restrictions than we have why the fuck wouldn t we be able to keep afloat with these two measures please admins i beg of you don t destroy this place that we call home when there are very easy fixes to the problems at hand thank you']

['hello team i m the guy from back on yes i record the numbers of all my posted confessions in case you don t remember who i am i m the guy who had a crush on a girl in my org for months and then was informed by her that she had a boyfriend seconds before i was gonna ask her outi m back to share with all of you the conclusions i ve drawn and more importantly pass onto you a piece of advice based on a realization i had after smoldering about this over the last two weeks note i actually wrote a response to another post that responded to the original confession but it got posted about minutes before got zucced so yeah didn t have much time to circulate besides this post will be of much more value and greater quality i hope first things first i am touched by the outpour of support and sympathy i got on the original post on i was absolutely not expecting all of you to be so interested and i am genuinely floored and grateful thank you all so very muchso after two weeks of mulling over what i could have done differently i personally felt that i wasn t dealt a very good hand of cards to start with i fell for a lady who was a year ahead of myself and graduating in quarters whilst i still had to go who held a leadership position in the org i was in and supremely busy and thus really difficult to talk to i couldn t get over the fact that she was in the context of the org my superior and thus i stopped myself from proactively trying to get to know her better and getting closer to her i couldn t get over the personal belief of how it is supremely inappropriate to develop feelings of romance for your higher ups and that you ought to maintain a courteous professional and somewhat distanced relationship with them a product of my upbringing the person who responded to my original confession on stated that i didn t really know her for who she was and that i just had a severe case of infatuation perhaps but i like to think i was able to cobble together a rough sketch of who she truly was based on what she s shared with us the org and what i ve heard from others and then made an informed decision to go after her based on that sketch she was a very strong woman who knew what she wanted from life and refused to take shit from anyone else yet immensely caring and compassionate she looked out for the well being of everyone in our org it s fairly small and knew its quirks like the back of her hand she was immensely intelligent and a politics and military buff specifically military strategy in short she possessed a number of admirable qualities and traits qualities that i look for in a lady and my god was she a fine lady thinking back i realize that even if she had been single and i had been more assertive we probably would ve ended up getting together sometime in late february or early march and considering that she s graduating in june i probably would ve been dumped around this time i don t think months or so is nearly enough time to build the necessary foundations for a lasting off campus relationship and while i believe in lord tennyson s words tis better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all i think the devastation would have been far worse had this been the case also i think it s safe to assume that she s probably been dating this person she s with for a fair while most likely even before she returned from her business across the country in january so given the realities of the situation there really wasn t much i could do in fact i think i was shit out of luck from the get go the only way i could ve gotten with her realistically was if i joined the org with her last year which is a preposterous hypothetical a as a newbie freshman i wasn t ready to immerse myself into clubs yet b i wasn t even sure i was going to join that org until earlier this year and that s only because it fit into my schedule and c i mean how could i have known at the time that if i joined that org i d meet and fall for a very lovely single lady with whom i shared similar interests and that s when it dawned on meit is highly unlikely statistically speaking that she is the only person on this campus with whom i d click and i d share similar interests what if there are other women out here at ucsd who are just like her with whom i can bond it s just they re scattered all over campus in different lecture halls and colleges and orgs and i haven t had to opportunity to encounter them yetand that gives me hope for the futureit tells me that odds are i ll probably bump into another lady just like her who d make me feel all of these things again and god willing be single so i needn t worry too much i shouldn t aggressively go around campus looking for a new crush i should concentrate on myself and live life to the fullest and enjoy my time here at ucsd and focus on self improvement on becoming the best person i can be that is what i ve learned from this experience and that s the advice i want to pass on to youyou the reader the lovely single men and women of the confessions community who are frustrated with your lot in life the most wonderful people enter your life when you least expect them so get out there talk to the people around you join that org go to that social or that trivia night comment on that post on confessions live life to the fullest without regrets and without looking back you may end up finding the woman man of your dreams as well as friends for life as well as learn a whole plethora of new things about yourself and the world around you i know i ve found at least one of those two things i know all of this sounds cliche and cloyingly optimistic but it s absolutely true i guarantee itto those who ve stuck with me and read this far thank you very much to those who will

['no one cares the thought that echoes in my mind every morning when i wake when i brush my teeth when i go to school and until i drift into the emptiness at night to realize that it s no one s responsibility to care is a heart shattering realization to know that you re falling deeper and deeper into a pit and know that any one of the people you re falling past could reach out and pull you back into the safety of love acceptance and empathy maybe they don t know you re suffering maybe they re not paying attention maybe they have their own problems to figure out maybe they realize how much of a burden it is to be your friend and it s easier to avoid regardless of the reason the truth is that you re alone alone with your thoughts alone with your feelings alone with your cares and desires in this world this sense of loneliness compounds with every glance at a kissing couple friends laughing etc you ask yourself why other people have friends have significant others have love acceptance have fun and the only rationale explanation is that you weren t chosen this feeling of being the last one picked the odd one out is something you ve become all too familiar with from gym class and teams in middle school to projects in college the polite ones glance down to avoid eye contact or say ummm i m actually already with x you realize pretty quickly that you ve been standing for too long left out hanging your body squirms with the discomfort from the gaze of others your entire existence is skipped over until the silence of the second last person being picked and you slowly drag yourself over to the other team last picked alludes to some notion of being chosen when that couldn t be further from the truth you weren t chosen an unlucky team or person was stuck with you you re given to someone who doesn t want you like an ad placed in your mailbox or more adeptly a parking ticket stuck onto someone s windshield you didn t choose this life of torment and yet it was likewise thrust upon youyou ask yourself where did it all go wrong how could you be born into this world like everyone else yet end up so different so far from everyone else everyone s origin story is different mine began in middle school before i felt like i was just another kid for the most part things changed when i was evicted from my elementary school and forcibly placed into middle school i was warned that the school might be a bad culture fit like the naive kid i was i didn t give it much thought the message that i was unwanted was slowly bled into my mind from the teachers to the students it was made clear that no one wanted me there i didn t belong i wasn t white i wasn t rich i didn t play club sports i didn t wear quick silver hurley or the stereotypical clothes from other students a memory etched eternally in my mind is returning to class after lunch and since all the boys played outside we were all sweaty and dirty my eighth grade teacher greeted each of them with a smile but that smile quickly vanished when her eyes laid on me go clean yourself up you look absolutely disgusting still echoes in my mind and the feeling of being lesser than are still branded in mind with a wound as fresh as the day those hot iron words struck my ears this realization wasn t something that happened overnight it was like most things in this world slow and steady you begin as a flat grassy field with just a small trickle of disgust and disdain for your existence trickling through and before you know it you re left with a huge hole in your existence a giant grand canyon of with thunderous waves of anxiety depression and self loathingtime passes and the people around you change you change schools and eventually leave to a different city for college your tormentors and peers long forget about you with you being a distant memory ever shrinking in their rear view mirror as they drive toward their rest discovering the fruits of life things that make things worth living friends love and success you cough as the dust spun up by the tires catches in your throat and eventually they fade from your view but they ve left their mark upon you forever what was outside and external these thoughts of not being accepted of being ugly of not being good enough have slowly but surely seeped through the pores of your skin and now have corrupted your mind they don t need to be there to say it anymore because your mind already says it for them you don t need to hear the laughter from others when they make fun of your feelings on a crush you now tell yourself no you know that you re not good enough undeserving of love undeserving of affection undeserving of friendship filled with rage at yourself for being stupid enough to think that you could ever have those things you saw others enjoy the hand of life slaps your childlike hands away from the candy at the supermarket checkout counter like a scolding mother how many bad days does it take to change you a person to corrupt what one was good kind and loving into something cynical maybe every rejection every mean jab ever made maybe every hurtful thing is like a stab to your heart until the skin scars and hardens how many more days can you take before you decide it s preferable to die and kill yourself rather than go on another day locked inside of your mind your life what will be the final thing that breaks you so utterly and completely you lose all hope for life do you know what or when it will be or does it strike from nowhere i know not the answers to these questions but am afraid i may find out the

grateful as i can especially to my family they try to give me a better future in their own way this was just what i wrote in an hour when left to myself for an hoursome backstory i m just your average kiddo trying his best my dad left to america when i was six to work and i lived with my mom my entire until i came to live with my dad for high school i have always been told to do my work now and good things will eventually come i m still waiting for them to come i have been suicidal for too many years that i can t count anymore or maybe not is it normal to think about killing yourself i ve only ever seriously tried to commit suicide three times and that was when i was much younger the other times i pussyed out i don t think i ll commit suicide anymore either i ve spent most my life saying i ve already toughed this much out might as well wait for good times anyways the rest of this is kind of long and just my thoughts i tried to paragraph them the best i could i hopped between topics that were on my mind so if it is hard to read i m sorryyour life is a joke your family are basically robots and they don t care about shit other than success asian culture is possibly the worst possible methodology of raising a child raising a kid and allowing him to pursue his passion is what is always preached but never used i ve actually had my parents straight up say they don t care what my passion is it s like i m not living my own life i m just walking down a pre laid path stumbling around until i die i wonder what the suicide rates among asians are compared to the rest of the population is it really a tragedy when a student commits suicide is it really uncommon there was already a student that committed suicide this fall quarter but nobody addresses it they just brush it under the rug and pretend like it has never happened i didn t even know until now what kind of system does that is it a fault in our system that causes that if i were to commit suicide i feel as if i was determined it would already be too late i m a stubborn guy haha if i was like this is it and i will commit suicide i would always be curious what kind of people are truly kind and true to themselves as much as i criticize on my family for only being there for face value and never really showing others how they really feel i honestly do the same i feel as though i might be a sociopath or psychopath in that sense i wonder if all my family is like thatthey never really show their emotions and they just do whatever it takes to better their own state they don t take into account other people and they will easily throw someone to the curb in order to better themselves i feel as though they only do charity or seem kind so that they can front or tell themselves that they are genuinely good people i do that too i m not a saint i m a major hypocrite all my life i ve been wondering if i am a good person do good people really doubt whether they re even nice they just do it unconditionally if i have to think i m going to be a good person i can t be a genuinely good person i m proud to say unlike my family that i feel sympathy though i hold so much sympathy and patience for so many people except my family i don t know why but my patience runs thin with them and i get frustrated so easily by them now maybe its because my family is the only people who i get to see behind the curtains i see them when they pretend to be nice laugh at other peoples jokes and then turn around and scoff at how they re stupid they re lack of sympathy and empathy projecting their anger on anyone even if they have nothing to do with anythingi remember specifically this one time my family was traveling and we took a taxi to a hotel that took a longer route just to make money i understand it is scummy and hey they shouldn t have done that and taken advantage of usi would be mad too but since the taxi already left there wasn t much we could do then my father went into the hotel and berated the woman who was working the front desk for what the taxi service has done why that person had nothing to do with what they did why would you get worked up and mad at her specifically they can t do anything about it i tried to calm him down and tell him to relax what would yelling at them do they aren t even responsible for what happened and then he pushed me to the side and yelled at me he said this does not involve you after he was done yelling at the clerk he came over to me and said see this is why you can t let them take advantage of you never just get stepped on and always stand up for yourself did you really think that was a valuable lesson a teaching moment all it let me know is that i can t believe in my family they can t be my role models they honestly aren t anything like me the dad that i have memories of the one that i remember that had so much happiness and saw the world with so much love and care and sympathy was very different then the real one i have i guess it s just the memory of a kid that s years old that romanticize everything and sees people as perfect but i don t know when i was younger i still knew my dad had anger issues but it was ok because he was still a good person at heart right my mom is a different story i m not sure what fond memory i have with her all i remember is being forced to do things i didn t want all i remember is getting beaten all the time the memory that comes to me most is when i was in the corner and she punched me in the face and i fell on the ground the memory is so muddled now and i can t remember why she did it anymore all i remember was the shock pain and sadness most of what is messed up with me i feel like is sourced from my mom i actually think i might have been traumatized haha my mom and my brother used my fear of the dark against me to make me do what they wanted all i wanted to do was play with my friends and i understand that work needs to be done but i only got to work when i was younger all those times locked in the garage and the basement i still remember the fear and the hours i spent crying i remember one time when i wanted to run away from home and actually got the courage to do it i left and ran crying the entire time of course i couldn t even outrun my sister she convinced me to come back her kindness is the only thing in my family and when i came back the look on my moms face devoid of any sympathy just straight anger hilariousi m not sure maybe i m just lonely i ve tried to fill my life with things that might make me feel better i ve taken drugs before i ve surrounded myself with friends but whenever i m alone i always think like this nothing really gets better loneliness can t really be solved by anything']

['i find it difficult to fit in with people my age as cliche as this may sound i personally believe i was born in the wrong era i was born in asia and raised almost solely by my grandparents until i was although they continued to look after me until my early teenage years they re truly wonderful people and i m proud to say that they alongside my single mother and my biological uncle who i call my dad raised me right as far as i m concerned but the downside is that i ve absorbed a lot of their mannerisms and viewpoints while i know which beliefs and points of views to discard as they are wholly inappropriate for today s day and age enough of their influence on me remain to this day to where i believe i am a middle aged man at least in a year old guy s body consequently it s hard for me to make too many friends or find very many romantic interests in no particular order here s a list of my characteristics and experiences that lead me to that conclusion for lack of a better way to introduce this list throughout middle and high school i ve successfully befriended a number of my teachers and sometimes found their company more enjoyable than that of some of my peers very down to earth big history and politics nut absolutely can t care for and can do without pop culture at least modern pop culture i generally consider an intellectual a highbrow person to a fault quite behind on the sayings and memes of today didn t know what a dumpster fire was besides a literal fire in a dumpster until about two months or so ago while i watch people play a variety of video games on youtube i am not in any way shape or form a gamer myself i don t have netflix or hulu and i genuinely do not recognize them as being legitimate competitors with regards to their output to television for me tv today is crap with too many commercials and too much gratuitous sex and violence same goes for movies today i just find tv and movies from yesteryear far better and more entertaining in many ways in regards to tv i m a big fan of informative programs in depth news programs the news in general etc from yesteryear and today and light entertainment shit like game shows and comedy programs panel shows improv satire topical stuff so shows like mock the week from the uk and whose line from both the uk and us if you want an idea i generally watch tv shows and movies from at least years ago if not more i generally don t do animation except for things that make me feel nostalgic spongebob most of the stuff from early s nickelodeon and cartoon network the simpsons and a few other things i have never watched anime nor do i have any desire or interest to and disney films are meh to me i feel like i ve outgrown them i don t care for edm or rap or most of the rubbish they put on radio nowadays which puts me at odds with about of this campus and people my age in my opinion i m a big classic rock fan love the beatles sgt pepper s onwards although i don t have any other particular bands that i like i like individual songs more than bands my music collection is comprised of rock from the s to the s along with some disco new wave instrumental easy listening and other things my philosophy when it comes to what i watch and listen to boils down to two main ideas a i like what i like and b i don t care what the hell people listen to watch these days if you re really as good as people claim you are i ll hear about you again in years time and i ll see watch you then i was taught to respect hierarchy wherever it exists which makes it hard for me to mix in with the very active leadership of the org i m involved in and get to know them as people i see them as my superiors rather than as my peers and fellow humans and consequently i feel that it s improper to pursue anything else but a good working relationship with them this is in spite of having attended multiple house parties with them where i witnessed them getting absolutely blitzed and consequently got to learn the most incredible and personal things about them my idea of a fun time with friends is around a table with drinks and or good food and just chatting and laughing the night away in solid conversation no need for loud music or shouting or a darkened room with flashing lights or drunkenness i am not a clubber never envision myself going out clubbing at any time ever can t stand club music specifically it s loudness generally don t like the club scene or staying out into the wee hours of the morning tries to finish all my work so i can sleep by midnight or at the latest still a defender of the notion that chivalry isn t dead of treating everyone with kindness and respect irrespective of who what they are in relation to you of loyalty and commitment to family friends romantic partners etc still explicitly asks girls out on a date still a believer in giving flowers and chocolates just because still a believer in true love similarly i absolutely do not believe in tinder don t have one don t intend on making one i m looking for something real and enduring i don t have the time or energy for casual flings or one time hookups similarly i don t have the time or energy for fake people and fake friends consequently my circle of friends is relatively small i genuinely believe we our generation need to physically interact with each other more and learn to love each other more we need to stop being so shallow we need to have more genuine human connection i ve been told by a variety of people in my life that i act more maturely than the average person of my age i believe that i m more mature than a lot of people myself i do not believe i am anywhere near the most mature being ever but certainly above average i know it sounds like i m tooting my own horn but judging by what others tell me and from what i believe i think it s true i have very little patience for immaturity and childish behavior i m allergic to bullshit and stupidity despite possessing the capability to be stupid myself sometimes i look and sound older than i actually am and i think that s about it essentially the tl dr version of all of this is that i have antiquated and unconventional tastes in just about everything when compared to the average year old college kid and it s hard for me to fit in with many people my age i know the list kinda makes me sound like an conceited arrogant bastard but i swear to you i m not i m not trying to toot my own horn nor am i complaining exactly i just felt the need to unload and you know this has been rather therapeutic to me it s taken a load off my chest feel free to leave your thoughts or not if you made it this far through the whole list congratulations you ve reached the end give yourself a choccy']

['i ve never been in a relationship before the last time i almost did was during my first year of collegebeing my first year i was trying to go out visit the beach and meet people but more than anything i wanted to build friendships one evening i found myself visiting one of the dining halls a little before closing after picking up my food i contemplated going back to my building and just eating my dinner in my room at my desk i probably wasn t thinking of it like this at the time but i wasn t giving myself an opportunity to meet anyone if i continued to do thatso i wandered the dining hall just a bit looking for a familiar face if there was any i did my best to not look lost or like i was trying to not be alone i was pretty sure there wasn t anyone around and just as i was about to leave the dining hall i saw him he was eating alone no distractions in front of him no phone no headphones i knew i d seen him around before probably in one of my classes or my building so i walked over and greeted him we introduced each other and i asked if i could join him for dinner he accepted we ended up talking a lot that evening the dining hall had been cleaned and prepped for the next day by the time we were asked to leave as we were leaving the dining hall i remember not wanting our conversation to end we spent more time together that night talking about i don t remember what a little bit of everything i supposewe ended up making plans to go on runs together grab lunch and dinner together he even introduced me to some of his favorite shows i didn t particularly enjoy them for the most part but spending time with him was funwe d go on runs together visit museums go to the beach do homework in the common rooms if we weren t in class we were hanging outi remember one night when most of his suite mates were gone either a holiday weekend or some break like that we were watching a movie in his room we were lying on his bed and at some point we just started pushing against each other playfully this playfulness escalated to the point where i had him pinned underneath me i never wrestled and i don t normally behave like thisi lowered my waist to meet his and as soon as i made contact i put a little more of my weight on him it didn t take long for us to start rubbing against each other it was a physical sensation i had not previously experiencedhe was my first lover my first kiss my first sleeping with someone i remember making my way to and from his room those few days in my pj s carrying my pillow and bringing snacks so we could cuddle play and watch tv togetherif this was all so great what are you confessing as great as it all was i wasn t ready for a relationship heck i m not even sure if i know what dating means anymore and if i ll ever get around to datingi wasn t relationship ready in general i had no sense of independence and having just started school i was afraid it was too early to start getting into anything like that but more than anything else i didn t know how to be with someone of the same gender as much fun as i had and yes i liked him there was too much for me to figure out i never questioned or really thought about my sexual orientation i didn t grow up particularly religious either for not having any strong convictions for or against such relationships i was very hesitant to go any further i never got around to seeing or experimenting with anyone before collegeit s been a few years since then i distanced myself from him because i didn t want to be thought of anything that i maybe wasn t if that makes sense as with some things hindsight offers me the opportunity to look back and realize that i missed an opportunity to try something new and with someone that was genuinely interested in seeing me grow and grow with me having shared all this i just want to remind myself and anyone having read this far that second chances don t come often and sometimes we fail to recognize opportunities for growth and self discovery the first time around']

['tldr boyfriend from two days ago i asked op for another chance i told her i made a mistake and i want to do right by her by me and by us she after a lot of pleading finally agreed to give me one last shot and this post today is meant to be something to help me clear my conscience before a new beginning as well as my plea to all other people in a relationship to not make the same mistakes i did ever since that night that i first saw you in class my life hasn t been the same my love i enjoyed our journey as much as you did but i also know it hasn t been easy for you you told people the smiles and rainbows of us it s only fitting i bear the blame for our darkest moments before i can proceed on a fresh start with youi remember looking at u for the first time in our class of people and just thinking to myself those are the prettiest eyes and smile i have ever seen i remember you in your olive jeans and denim jacket and being mesmerized with you from that first class i remember coming over to your place to do homework and asking you out that same night i told you that i didnt wanna be without you one moment because i didnt want to risk loosing you to some other guy who may ask you out that was the beginning of our adventure which you proceeded to tell people about in thank you baby for saving me the effort of typing so much out my confession is going to be relatively shorteri have hurt you a lot i know this isn t the first time i ve screwed up i know over the course of one year i have been battling a lot with my own paranoia and what it means to live life and i have projected that onto our relationship many times causing you so much pain my insecurities about us about myself would take many forms sometimes i would think dedicating time to you would snatch away from my classes and perhaps i should end it so i could focus on myself more sometimes i would think i ll eventually go off to grad school and we re statistically going to break up then maybe i should save us the heartbreak and just end this now i kissed another girl when in a wrong frame of mind and this last time i convinced myself that no matter how good our story is there are just parts of us that are incompatible i believe that a lot of other people out there face such decisions as i well they can t decide whether the choices they make are right or wrong and are often just befuddled by my relationship baby i ve never been under so much distress under any of my relationships and i honestly feel that my paranoia comes from the fact that your really the first girlfriend whose stood out to me as someone i may wanna spend my life with as a result my brain tries to find all the reasons to not let go and surrender myself to you i keep coming up with excuses and reasons why we shouldn t be together as listed in the past paragraph when the only real think i had to consider was whether i wanted to be with u and whether or not you made me happy i tried to find the s of reasons why we can t work when all i needed to look for was the one reason we can and that reason is simple you send butterflies through my stomach everytime you throw me a sincere smile or sashy with attitude or even when ur just lying on my chest at am before we start the day and go to our classesbaby this relationship has caused us both to go through tough times and i m blessed that i got to go through these things with someone as strong as you you ve helped me through one of the most uncertain periods of my life i m not gonna lie i dont deserve you baby i really don t you were there for me high and low and now i want the chance to be there for you as well you ve helped me when i wasn t sure of what it even meant to love you were with me when i kissed someone else when half drunk sure u were as angry as hulk and ik the incident hurt u way more than you let on in front of me but i m fortunate that you didn t leave me in that treacherous timea lot of this is really personal to me and the only reason i m posting it on a page like this is because i want to encourage people to learn from the mistakes i ve made and from the things my baby did right through this past year i ve learned that to be in love with someone is more than the moments you share with them the songs you both jam to the hours you spend studying before a final the crazy adventures you take with one another to love someone is to believe in someone else to love is to forgive and persevere i m not saying that everyone should be forgiven for whatever wrong doings they do in a relationship but i am saying that it s unfair to keep posing hypothetical questions about why things will fail instead of posing the hypothetical question what if things work i made that mistake and my girlfriend was strong enough to stick by me through each high and low and for that i am grateful i wish i could be more like you baby try to trust people with your heart ps my love if you read this you recently asked me why you should give me another chance and baby all i have to say is that i want another chance to do right by you and just like naruto never gave up on his dream to be hokage or just like amy farrah fowler didn t give up on sheldon cooper despite his quirky personality i m not ready to give up on who we may become just yet i can t force you to take me back and i can t promise that the road from here on out is gonna be flowers and roses but baby it s taken me some time to understand you re the only one i wanna go down this road with because you re the one i believe in now']

['triton gaming is probably the biggest cesspool of a student org on campus they re basically an unofficial fraternity except worse in a lot of ways the worst part is that they refuse to acknowledge or admit that anything s wrong despite being an organization for video games i ve never seen a higher concentration of ravers and drug abusers in one place i ve seen innocent young freshman turn into cocaine addicts directly due to being part of the club in most organizations you can just say i want to join and become part of the fun but really the only way to join triton gaming is to interview to become an officer which is essentially rushing a frat with a recruitment period initiation and hazing included otherwise it s a cliquey mess that ll remind you of those high school dramas on tv the amount of gossip and rumors that get passed around is absolutely mind boggling the closest thing to being a general member you can get is by paying them for a piece of plastic with a logo so you can get imaginary points at their events and even if you just try hanging out with the members like a regular person they ll shit talk the people behind their backs making every effort to exclude them until they stop showing upand you d think that a gaming organization would be overwhelmingly male since that s the primary demographic for gamers but the org will basically take in any cute girl turning into a pathetic hunting ground for their attention good luck getting in if you re a male who isn t already friends with someone inside they stalk female applicants social media as an unofficial part of their application process commenting on how they look as if they re grocery shopping some of the female members don t even play games in an exclusive gaming club guys will pick up girls as littles just to get a chance to sleep with them and no one seems to have a problem with that their families are just an incestuous dating platform even structurally they re just a monopoly of several orgs breaking the rules that other orgs have to follow left and right they have a separate organization for each game but really that s just so they can book more rooms and get an office to themselves they ve figured out the funding system to a t taking campus money that s meant to give money to support events but instead they use the money to buy lunch and dinner for the officers half their organizations don t hold a general meeting like they re supposed to every quarter and don t even do anything besides support the main organization the confusing part is that if you join one of their orgs but not the main one they won t even really consider you part of the org unless you ve specifically joined triton gaming the coolest part of triton gaming is probably all their sponsorships which provides them with a lot of the prizing but for a lot of the good prizing they ll just host a tournament and have their competitive team players sweep the competition to get thousands of dollars of prizing for themselves and even if you do manage to win prizing there are a ton of people who never get their prizing for some reason or anotherthe worst part is that everyone in the org knows that it s all at least somewhat true but they re all too stuck on their high horses to realize it']

['tldr trying to get over my boyfriend a compilation of our adventures on campus feel free to comment on the stupid shit i did it might make me feel better just ended things with my boyfriend and best friend he was my first and what we had was wildly special and rare but i thought i d share our year long escapade on campus you can try to guess what college we re in but there s not a college on campus we don t have a story in baby i know you will see this and i hope at least one of these makes you laugh or smile so here it goes the first night we hung out i was crazy enough to say i d go out with you our first week of dating consisted of us talking all night and listening to music that we would end up both sleeping in the dorm lounge i had never met anyone with a relatively similar music taste to mine until you in fact of the first days we were together you stayed the night the other night you stroked my hair until i fell asleep in the lounge and covered me with a sweater that was only after knowing you for less than hours i should ve thought you were a creep and ran away a week later the resident advisors said to not have friends sleep over in the common area i tried so hard to hold in my laughter at this meeting because i knew they were referring to us but we never got caught because no one had known who we were yet we later convinced someone to let us into the village study room that first weekend together and ended up sleeping there all night we even shared our first kiss there you thought you could wait to take me to fallen star that tuesday to kiss me but you just couldn t wait remember how cold it was and i was a freshie who couldn t find a bathroom so i ran across the street and peed in a bush i had quite the courage back then and you were still into me even after that to the guys who found us there in the morning and congratulated my bf nothing happened that day was both our first walk of shame that week we also looked at the stars from marshall field until the sprinklers went off on us and i thought we were in a movie although this also happened to us on the old fields by ap m we moved to the side where there was no sprinklers and the security guard just stared at us i was so self conscious but you had a way to calm me down and make me laugh i m thankful to all the security this year who let us be after just a few weeks together on thursday night we took a sleeping bag and slept in it together on rimac field so to the guy who asks if he can take a walk outside at am and to the other op who asks if they can walk on rimac field here is your answer we set an alarm to get out of there early thinking we wouldn t be seen but instead got woken up by maintenance mowing the lawn that was the day i learned you sleep like a log i was so embarrassed and scrambled to get out of the cold wet field what freaks we probably looked like carrying a sleeping bag across campus i didn t know how much i loved the thrill of sneaking around until i met you let me remind you of a few of my favorite memories that probably got all jumbled into a blur with the rest of our yearsomething we tend to forget is when we made out on the muir field triton emblem just hours before the school wide fire drill we probably only got hours of sleep before that fire alarm went off we also made out in our department s conference room and stairwells i m glad we never got caught and decided to divide business and pleasure one day you re going to have a meeting in that conference room and you re gonna blush about us stumbling over each other there in the dark i ve already had a conference there so i know what it feels like we also once tried to pull an all nighter in the doghouse at sixth but we fell asleep until the security found us and woke us up they asked me to wake up my boyfriend and you were passed out af i remember we went to the woods one night and you were terrified this night was the first time things got really spicy i think you tripped over a branch while you tried to take off my shirt i ve never seen you scramble so fast for your clothes like when that group of people went down there to smoke i m pretty sure you put your shirt on inside outi also remember very early in the year when you took me to th floor of geisel to study and i swore never to come back because i hated the silence i had tried to avoid geisel and you gave me more reason to you left me with your stupid altoids box while you tried to find better wifi connection dumbly i went searching for you with the mint box jingling as i walked the entire floor little did we know later that summer we d be in one of those study rooms making out without a care in the world years down the road i ll still remember when we snuck into the marshall sequoyah discussion rooms after hours and talked about family and life we were probably there longer than all the times i went there for my math discussion that quarteri wanted to reach every rooftop and view on campus by the end of the school year and baby i bet we did we watched the sunset from the top floor of rady we talked many times on the trail in warren behind cv with our hands intertwined overlooking the canyon as well as shared many kisses on those steps this was my happy place on days i could not see you we later found out about the rooftop on hss ap m not an original spot but this became a regular for us and was still a thrill but not as much of a rush as the night we went to the pc balcony what a view that was when we sat on your blanket and looked at the moon we stayed there way past closing time and were locked inside pc i was clutching your hand so tightly as i whispered we re gonna get caught they re gonna have us on video or there s a silent alarm as we walked out a few weeks later they locked the balcony and i wondered if it was because of us my favorite day of the week was friday not necessarily because it was the end of the school week but because of friday night dinners and ice cream with you on the weekends we would spend all day focused on a couch doing schoolwork not talking just exchanging music every now and then because after we would relax and watch movies together weekends were the best because you were the last thing i fell asleep to and the first person i woke up to i m gonna miss your arms holding me under the layers of blankets and being lazy with you i ll miss getting goody s and eating lunch at the hammocks in the sunshine i m never gonna forget that day we ditched school to walk down to the beach to the summertime lunches on top of the revelle keeling apartments i still vividly remember watching the sunset together on the th of july there when a group of summer program students came by we snuck to the th floor and watched it there instead i snapped a few pictures of you looking out at the sunset shortly before you swept your hands on to my hips and we stood and watched the colors dance across the skywe used to go on walks through erc and stop on the rooftop of cafe v looking down in the business of life inside we also laid on the grass outside nearby the laundry rooms and that was the first place you told me about your ex i hope i don t become a story like her one day when you would take me home i used to make you take me the long way so i could see the neon word lights at powell we spent so many nights outside shivering and exploring campus i feel sorry for the countless triton rides we had to call when it got too late and we were just a little too delirious wandering around with you was the best my favorite adventure was when we visited fallen star in the summer i was in love with how excited and amazed you were as you smiled down at the view what i would give to go back in time to that moment or any of these moments i m gonna love you for a while baby i hope that s okay']
