So far I've had 2 relapses this week... Right now I can't find the courage to message you because I am terrified of not knowing how you will respond to me... After I got off work today, I couldn't help but think of how badly I wanted to text you and knowing that I couldn't made me feel more sad...

I don't care about how it's best that I wait for you to text me back first, but I miss it all no matter how many times people tell me to move on... I've been told to move on so many times even though it's only been a few weeks, but I cannot just drop everything in a heartbeat because it all means a lot to me; YOU mean a lot to me still... No matter how many times you tell me you're not sure, I still want to be with you... I miss looking forward to seeing you each week and visiting you and your family and going to church with you all even if I can't understand what they're saying... All the good things I did were for you, because I really did care and do care for you now... I wish you could have accepted me at my worst... I wish you would accept my calls and let me talk to you because I am genuinely trying to change for you and hopefully prove to you that I can change.. I don't know the real meaning behind the words you tell me, but I can only take them how I read it and believe what you tell me... I love you so much, and I haven't shown it that well before we broke up, but if I didn't then I wouldn't have dedicated so much time to you and visit you... You were my priority, and I even cared about you more than I cared about myself sometimes...

13861,2019-05-17 22:41:20,"I don't believe Alvin Kang is innocent. 

Anybody who has taken Chinese with Cha Laoshi knows how kind and gentle-hearted he is. When I took his class in 2018, he caught people cheating but let them off with a stern warning (for cheating on hw tho). Samuel Cha has a sterling reputation at UCSD, and he isn't one to accuse a student of cheating and report them to AIO without substantial reason/evidence. 

Also, Alvin's explanation of what happened in confessions 3.0 was super unclear and sounds like he's deliberately leaving incriminating information out. It's 2019, anybody can spoof a Google maps location (people did it all the time to cheat on Pokemon go). No professor just randomly decides to accuse you of cheating without evidence. Interesting how Alvin doesn't mention any of the evidence against him, and I'm sure he has no interest in doing so either. If you've ever taken a class with Samuel Cha, you would agree with me that something about Alvin's story doesn't add up. 

Don't get me wrong, it's totally possible that Alvin is innocent. But until he's willing to share with us ALL the facts of his case CLEARLY, y'all shouldn't donate a cent to his GoFundMe.

13722,2019-05-15 23:47:40,"For the second time recently, a dude who I just met/do not know well has poured out all of their mental health concerns on me. In both cases, I recommended therapy, and in both cases, they said that there's nothing a therapist could tell them that they don't already know/didn't think of. One of them has essentially made me his therapist yet refuses to have an open mind about anything, and also can't share anything with his family/friends due to fear of judgement. 

I can't say that all men do this, or that only men do, but it really seems like a symptom of toxic masculinity. First of all, do you really think you've thought of EVERYTHING that someone who studied for years specifically to help people like you has? Why are you so against trying it out? Why can't you talk to your other guy friends instead of a random girl you met in lecture or at a party? Why do you think you're above getting help?

My hunch is that men are expected to be able to handle their emotions themselves, whereas women are seen as more emotional (and thus treatment is more acceptable). For guys, showing emotions, having mental health issues, or getting help would be a sign of weakness. 

Please take care of your mental health. Ask your guy friends how they're really doing. Support each other! And if you need to, be open to therapy, because it'll help. I can at the very least guarantee it'll help more than spilling your guts out to a stranger who did not ask to be your sole source of emotional support.

Now my white friend is WAAY more qualified than my Asian friend, BUT, since he believes people should go first just because they're not white and not because they're more talented, I went ahead and referred my not as qualified asian friend just to hold him to his own principle.

I've spent some years trying to improve my attitude towards women and respect them. But recently I did something messed up, and now it seems like all of my effort was a waste, and that no matter how much work I put in I still fall back to the same harmful thoughts.

I think this goes deeper than society conditioning me to think like this (if that's plausible or a thing), but my behavior towards women seems to be the most troubling atm. I really do want to talk with my female friends and family about this, but I'm scared as hell that they'll just disregard my feelings about all of this, just throw solutions without listening, or see me in a negative light.

But I'm not here to share my life story. I want to be better than this. I don't like harming the people around me, regardless if I care for them or not. For anyone who's also struggled with this, what things have you done to recover? Therapy seems nice, but it looks expensive (money's tight) and we all know CAPS has a waiting list for months.

Women don't seem to have much of a problem being my friend and keeping me around as long as its at a friendly distance. Any interest I show is just treated as unwanted and unsolicited attention.

And it bothers me because this is nothing new, and I've put so much effort into dressing nicer, getting fit, acting kinder, improving my speaking, getting some more hobbies and skills. But it seems like its all for nothing. Some of my friends say maybe i try to hard. But what am i supposed to do? In everything else in my life, there is a clear correlation between how much effort i put in and the results i get. But when it comes to romance if i put in no effort=shit results. If i put in effort=shit results. and now im just insecure, frustrated, and lonely.

All i really want to do is share my love. I'd really like to court a strong, intelligent woman and help her get what she wants from life. I've got a pretty good thing going on, but it really isnt that fun to do everything feeling so alone. It just feels selfish and hedonistic and I want to live for the benefit and prosperity of others. It'd be nice to think im worth something, and all i want to do is prove it to someone who i care about and who cares about me. 

Sometimes i arrive to the conclusion that I'm either a jerk or weapon-grade ugly.

1) Please actually tell us your complete order rather than having us interview you for the specs of what you want. For example, what size drink you want, what kind of bagel/donut you want, whether you want cream cheese with your bagel, whether or not you want whipped cream. We aren‚Äôt mind readers, and when there are 30 customers in line during a rush its really inconvenient for everyone if we have to spend time figuring out what you want if you just come up and order ‚Äúa london fog and a bagel.‚Äù

2) If you‚Äôre not paying with dining dollars and we ask if it‚Äôs going to be dining dollars, just say ‚Äúno‚Äù instead of saying yes and then pulling out your credit card bc then we have to cancel and change payment method, which is inconvenient especially during a rush. And if its not dining dollars, it would be helpful if you actually said what the payment is going to be instead of having us grill you with ‚Äúcard? Cash? Community?‚Äù

3) Take off your headphones/earbuds when you talk to us. Maybe then you‚Äôd actually hear what we are saying rather than just guessing. 

4) If you are paying with dining dollars and we ask if the payment is dining dollars, JUST SAY YES. Showing us your ID MEANS NOTHING. An ID can be used as a payment method for any number of things, including DD, Community Dining, Triton Cash, or PerQ. Just do us the common decency of answering the question instead of standing silently and showing us your ID. 

5) Dont try to scam us buy putting your ID on top of someone else‚Äôs ID and then tapping theirs. We aren‚Äôt stupid and it‚Äôs really awkward for us to have to call you out on that. ",,"serious, complaint",

We both give each other enough space and spend time apart. Although she makes time for me I feel that her new set of friends takes away her priority to me.

Also as she moved away from her house, she has gotten more independence and is experiencing things she never did with me and I hate it. I try to be supportive and caring but I'm just jealous when she's hanging 24*7 with her friends (and obviously guys make me more insecure) and also when she goes on trips with them. I know it's important to understand in a long distance that her life is still to continue and expand and I try to act normal on it. But it fucking sucks, she sees right through it and it has been repeating for long and I can't hold these standards anymore. I just want to be selfish in love and even though at the bottom of my heart I know she really loves me, it's just that she has this friendly personality and gets along with guys really well.

13742,2019-05-13 15:08:32,"My boyfriend has a secure folder for nudes and videos. A few months into our relationship, he got a new phone and decided to only transfer over our videos. When I saw the folder, however, there was still a video of him fucking his old fwb and he said he had no idea how it transferred over and he couldn't figure out how to delete it so he just left it. 

I try not to let jealousy influence my actions, so I haven't said anything other than the fact that he still had that video bothered me. He agreed it was wrong for him to still have that video, but never said anything about deleting it so I don't know if he still has it.

The fwb is his coworker and they stayed close friends after they stopped hooking up, until for some reason she turned cold to him and talked shit about him to his friends. This ended up isolating my bf from his friend group and he took it super hard. This isn't the first time she threw him under the bus. Still, they follow each other and stuff. Recently I guess she started to warm up to him again and they've been talking at work and stuff. 

The thing is, I come to work with him when I don't have class and just do my homework there (he works at a boba shop) because he gets lonely and frustrated by customers while on shift sometimes. It does make me very jealous when he has me come to his work and he ends up not even talking to me, and basically spends all his time talking to the fwb instead. Granted, they are working together so I guess its easier to talk to her than to me, but recently its been bothering me so much that I have to leave and walk to the Starbucks across the street instead.

I suppose I'm just venting here because I'm really frustrated that he would let someone into his life like that. I definitely have a huge personal bias since I did literally see my boyfriend fuck this girl. On a larger picture, he's always tried to stay friends with his exes, but they end up not talking anymore because the girls  dislike him after a while for some reason (like the fwb). I'm admittedly glad they don't talk, but it makes me uncomfortable that his doors are always open to them.

	So at the beginning of the school year, I came to college still kinda together with my girlfriend. We were gonna try long distance but we were gonna be far enough apart that we‚Äôd only ever be able to see each other on breaks. Things ended pretty quickly into the beginning of fall quarter, but we wanted to stay friends. But pretty much from when we broke up, she treated me terribly. She kept cancelling on plans to talk (or hang out when we were on break) and sometimes she didn‚Äôt even say she was cancelling and just went out to do something else instead. And through all of this, she still tried to tell me that she cared about me. She even bought a plane ticket to fly here and visit at the beginning of winter quarter. By the beginning of winter quarter though, I was really pissed off at all of her immature behavior and almost considered telling her not to come, but I didn‚Äôt in the end. About a week after she left SD, I decided to cut her out of my life because she was being a shitty friend, and conversations that we had when she visited really opened my eyes to some truths about her. She basically has no moral compass and wasn‚Äôt really bothered at all when one of her friends sexually assaulted someone else. She‚Äôs also extraordinarily immature and irresponsible and needs help doing the most basic tasks of living. I think cutting her out of my life was one of the best decisions I‚Äôve ever made because there‚Äôs a lot of things that I just couldn‚Äôt see when I was in a relationship with her, but I realized that she was really abusive. She would get mad at me for not knowing exactly what she was thinking a lot. She‚Äôd also say that we should break up, and expect me to convince her that we shouldn‚Äôt if she was unhappy with me. One time, when she called me over the summer and said that she thought we should break up, I told her that if she couldn‚Äôt handle long distance then it was fine and we should. She then got really mad at me because I was supposed to tell her that we should stay together. She even brought this incident up to some of our friends as if I had done something wrong by agreeing with her. Also, she was always wanting to do sexual activities. If I didn‚Äôt want to but she did, she‚Äôd get mad at me. She basically told me that if I was attracted to her then I would want to. She didn‚Äôt ever consider that sometimes I wasn‚Äôt in the mood or I didn‚Äôt want to do certain things. In the summer before college, she kept putting a lot of pressure on me to have intercourse (an activity which I have no interest in). I tried saying no, saying that we shouldn‚Äôt do it. But she kept pressing me and would ask, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you want to?‚Äù And I wasn‚Äôt really sure how to respond ever, because if I said no, she would get mad because that would mean that ‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt attracted to her.‚Äù I really didn‚Äôt want too though and my answers of ‚Äúno‚Äù weren‚Äôt working and she couldn‚Äôt take the hint. Luckily I was never forced to do that with her, mostly because for the end of our relationship, I mostly just stopped doing any kind of sexual activities with her.
There‚Äôs a part of me that doesn‚Äôt understand how I let myself be caught up in a relationship with somebody who‚Äôs so horrible (and it‚Äôs not just me, she‚Äôs lost a number of friends since starting college). On the other hand, I think I know so much more now. I know everything that I don‚Äôt want next time. And, I‚Äôm happy being single after basically being tethered to her for a year and I‚Äôve met people who are so much better now. I guess the story has a good ending. Some of you may know who I am, some may not, but I‚Äôd like to thank everyone here who has made this year so amazing!",,"serious, sex, dating, abuse",

But the truth is even though I love math with all my heart and have a wonderful job as a coder, I love performing. I am a decent singer (or at least everybody around me has been kind enough to feed me that delusion.) And I love the adrenaline rush of stage fright. No rollercoaster, skydiving, horror film, or near death experience has ever given me the same thrill performing in front of an audience has given me. And I've done acting, singing, marching band and I sincerely miss that rush of everybody focusing in on me. 

But the reason I didn't as a student, nor will I ever chase a career or even a hobby as a performing artist is because I'm terrified of being famous. I have skeletons in my closet. I have said and done horrible things that I know for fact will not now or ever be forgiven (and on a side note, to the lgbtq and women of this world, I want you to know that i regret every single horrible thing I've said about you. I'm sorry I was a bigot. And I'm sorry I caused you pain). And just knowing that one day, I will not only fall but fall so hard that I can never have a career in arts or anywhere else when the world knows my name and my sin is a nightmare for me.

Oh, completely irrelevant to the rest of this story, but it might also be of some interest and humor value to you to know that my other efforts to impress/humor/not appear ignorant in front of/humiliate myself in front of her included learning a few words in Afrikaans that are totally useless in polite conversation (well, except for ‚ÄúHello‚Äù and ‚ÄúGoodbye‚Äù), developing my impression of a white South African (which for some reasons unknown to me had flairs of Indian in it), spending around $20 on two pounds of frozen boerewors and another $50 on South African groceries (drinks, meat pies, Nik-Naks, rusks, etc.), picking up some NorCal slang, and acquiring a metric crap-ton of waterfowl related puns, among a couple of other things. Ahh, the things I do for love.

Anyways, back to the story. In the end, my quest for this lady ended in a great big fat failure and I had begun to think that I acquired all of this knowledge about South Africa and apartheid for naught (although admittedly, both topics had interested me for a time even before I met this lady). 

Then Tritons for Palestine set up that great wall on Library Walk and I got into a bit of a natter with some folks, some of whom were pro-Palestine, some of whom were anti-Palestine, and some of whom were absolutely neutral. Some of the people in the group (particularly those in the anti-Palestine camp) didn‚Äôt completely understand or vehemently disputed the connection between the situation in Palestine and apartheid South Africa and for the first time ever, I was able to whip out all of the newfound knowledge I had and put it to good use.

Just gonna help the admins out by saying a couple of things here (as a longtime member and semi-regular commentator/contributor on 3.0 myself)

1) If you were one of those people who reported content on 3.0 that led to that group‚Äôs dissolution, I hope you‚Äôve learned your lesson. If you reported content with the intent to get 3.0 dissolved, then may you never get laid again (or ever, if you‚Äôve never gotten any before) and may your genitals see as much action as a restaurant kitchen in North Korea.
2) REPORT TO THE ADMINS, NOT TO ZUCCBOI
3) If you want to see this new community flourish as much as the old one, try to get as many people on this page as possible. Tell all your fellow Tritons about it, get them to join, and then tell them to tell all of their fellow Tritons about it. You possess the ability to make 4.0 as great if not greater than 3.0. So do your part to help us and yourself out, ladies and gents.
4) TELL THEM TO REPORT ANY CONTENT TO THE ADMINS AND NOT ZUCCBOI
5) Lovin‚Äô the new submissions page with all the new categories, admins! You guys are marvelous! Keep up the great work!

I applied to UCLA, UCI, and UC Berkeley as a transfer student and got in  to all from UCSD: however, I do not know if I should take up the offer to go to either of them.

Some background info: I am a humanities major who is doing premed. My main reason for wanting to transfer to one of these is because they all offer a major I want to study that is not offered at UCSD. On the other hand, I feel like it would affect me negatively in the future in terms of premed prereqs. (For reference, I have only taken BILD 1-3, and Chem 6 series) I would be forced to take the Ochem series for engineers (aka non-bio majors) at UCLA, and ochem at UC berkeley, well gradee deflation much? In addition, UCSD is weird in the BILD 4/LD bio lab is not really equivalent to much? On the other hand, I really want to major and study ancient egyptology at these schools.

So the trade off is that to study at a school that has what I want, i would have to end up taking (subjectively) significantly premed courses. Honestly, I would love to transfer for my major, but if it ruins my GPA completely, I would obviously decide to not transfer.

I am just really conflicted about whether to transfer or not",,advice,

Their way of being curious is having a nibble; they're just strong jaws. That's why people in fucking cages when shark diving get ""attacked"". Sharks don't know what the fuck is that thing doing in the water and they want to know. We are allowed to just waltz into any fucking animal territory and study their homes and behavior how ever we like because of curiosity without thinking about invading their territory. There's fucking 16 annual shark attacks and 1 fatal shark attack EVERY. TWO. FUCKING. YEARS. You have a higher chance of dying to a fucking bullet ant than a shark. What's with people killing animals and poaching?!?!? Who in the right fucking mind looks into an animals eyes and fucking start cutting their horns off? That's like having other fucking people coming up to you and taking your fucking organs and selling it for money, which is the fucking black market organ trade. That's so fucking wrong but you're doing the same exact shit to animals but because we're on the top of the food chain or we are a more advanced organism living in this fucking world, it gives us the right to fucking do that to other animals but when it's done to us, it's fucking war. Don't fucking get mad at me and say shit like ""there's people out there who do good for these animals"". Yea no shit, there's people out there but there's also fucking good cops our there but all we fucking remember is those police officers who shoot black people just because they can. It's because we're wearing a uniform that represent the human race and there's fucking a lot of people who are out there making these adorable and loving animals go extinct. This is why I wish there's more diseases like cancer and the bubonic plague to fucking kill more humans; we're over populating this fucking world anyway and killing other animals just to sustain our selfish asses. Yea, say what if my family members get cancer? Honestly, that's just how life goes and it sucks. I'm willing to exchange 2.53 billion people for all the animals that aren't SUPPOSED to go extinct and have them back. It fucking sucks thinking how there's only 2 FUCKING NORTHERN WHITE RHINOS LEFT. It fucking sucks how some of us will never know how a fucking gorilla, tigers, sea turtles, orangutans, elephants, rhinos, or even saolas look like because we're too busy fucking killing other animals to keep ourselves alive. Don't give me crap about this is just survival of the fittest. These animals belong here and they are the reason why we have life on this shitty planet. I'm tired of seeing people treating other living things like shit. I'm tired of seeing people not know what belongs in the fucking trash or recycle or compost. I'm tired of dumb-ass people who are fucking in college and still don't know how to act as a fucking decent human being. People like that are a fucking waste of space and deserve to die.

unposted,2019-05-08 14:39:27,"#13268 I‚Äôm embarrassed as fuck that you‚Äôre the voice that‚Äôs chosen to represent Zionism on this page. If you don‚Äôt feel confident in your political views, don‚Äôt admit that when you call out someone else for theirs, especially anonymously.

Support for Israel in the United States should not be a monolith, the current Knesset government is ripe for criticism. However, this does not mean that all criticism of Israel is fair, or even truthful. From one liberal to many, here are the checks you can go through yourself to determine whether or not you‚Äôre an antisemite when you criticize Israel.

1. Am I demonizing Israel in the same way Jews are demonized by open anti-semites?
Example: instead of ‚ÄúThe state of Israel kills Palestinian babies! They‚Äôre evil!‚Äù say ‚Äúwhen the IDF responds with lethal force to rocks and firebombs being thrown at them in Gaza‚Äôs protests, children are often among the dead. I condemn Israel‚Äôs military for their actions but why do Palestinian protesters feel the need to bring their children to what they know will be a lethal backlash?‚Äù (Answer: Hamas pays its martyrs)

2. Am I delegitimizing Israel‚Äôs right to exist, even though self-determination is the same bedrock argument for Palestinian statehood?
Example: instead of ‚ÄúIsrael illegally stole land given to Palestine in the UN partition plan of 1947‚Äù, say, ‚ÄúWhile Palestinian leadership at the time walked away from the 1947 plan, it is long overdue for Palestinians to be given autonomous control over the West Bank and Gaza‚Äù (as long as said control isn‚Äôt government by terrorist organization but that‚Äôs my opinion showing again)

3. Am I applying a double standard to Israel that doesn‚Äôt apply to other countries?
Example: Calling for political and systemic violence against Israel for civilian casualties during war when only 2% of the casualties from President Obama‚Äôs drone strikes in Pakistan were known military leaders, and had over a thousand civilian injuries.

The Israel-Palestine conflict is one of the most difficult political topics to navigate. Both sides commit routine acts of murder because the other side won‚Äôt stop, and excessive, unchecked, improper criticism of both sides can lead to anti-semitism and islamophobia. If you cannot check your own rhetoric please stay out of the discussion.",,"trigger warning, israel",

At this moment if Israel's neighbors were to lay down their weapons and recognize Israel as the eternal and historical home of the Jews, where all can live free and prosper, there would be peace, but if Israel were to lay down its weapons, it would cease to exist.

He, Barr, Mnuchin, and countless others are claiming he is completely exonerated, and didnt collude, but then are stopping investigations from obtaining documents that, if they are telling the truth, would clear him. They literally have no reason to hide his tax returns, the Mueller report, etc. unless they are hiding something that could be detrimental to his presidency. We deserve the truth. 

Had Obama done anything REMOTELY close to this, Republicans would have said we have a tyrannical government and used their 2nd amendment rights by now on him. But no, Obama's biggest scandal was wearing a bike helmet when cycling once.  

For the Christians that support trump, I'm a Christian, but notice far too often that the majority of my religion and pastors support trump. This is insane. He has no regard for our faith and is playing the majority of us like fools, saying stuff like ""he brought back saying Merry Christmas"" to pander to the gullible among us, which I'm realizing is far too many. Nearly all of his policies go directly against what we stand for.

I know that there is separation of church and state, but for those Christians, stop and ask yourself ""what would Jesus do?"" Would he really want tax cuts for the rich and corporations and to throw millions of people off healthcare? Would he really want us to put a wall up and stop people from coming here for a better life, or tell those fleeing dictatorships and war torn countries to go back because we, as the richest country in the world, cant help them? Would he really want us to continue to pollute and destroy the one planet he gave us when there are plenty cleaner alternatives just because some rich people's businesses would go under? If you think yes to any of these, you are utterly mistaken for what Jesus stood for. Jesus always looked out for the poor and low among us and trump would never even voluntarily say hi to a person like that unless he knew it would be caught on camera and get him a few votes. 

It doesnt matter if you call yourself Christian, if you don't at least try to act like he did and help others, even strangers, like he calls on us to do, you are not a real Christian and he will judge you that way.

She is kinda condescending. Her opinions kinda reign over everyone else's. She is pretty liberal which I am too but when talking about political stuff she just seems to be static in her opinions. Like there's no discussion or desire to explore the topic, it's just her talking over until I agree usually it's fine since we are usually on the same side of the spectrum but it is annoying to not be able to say my opinion on the matter even if its the same. She also seems to already have an opinion of me or my situation when I go to her for advice. Like assumptions before I get to explain to her. 
I know some of you are gonna tell me to call her out on it or talk to her but I have a feeling if I start this conversation she is just gonna dig into me and my flaws. Not only that, but also our friend group is probably going to back her since they are closer with her than me.
I know I am making her out to be a horrible person overall. She's not. It's just certain moments that stay in my mind.
Also to add: (still referring to the roommate) I know it's midterm season, but that doesn't mean you get to be a bitch. Like we all have midterms and are super busy and stressed, but I still have the common decency to say hi and at least have a little small talk. I dunno maybe it's because I can handle stress more without changing my temperament but I'm just saying that midterms are not an excuse to be rude and curt to people.",,,

Maybe it's because i'm more conservative? (never really dated or partied, just never got around to it or just wasn't my scene) Or maybe because they were all friends before meeting me?
I'm not sure but I get really insecure about being the one on the sideline since it's always seemed that way in the past. In high school, I jumped from friend group to friend group until I found people I really connected with but then college happened and we became separated. I was really lonely when I got here until I met my roommates but now I have that outsider feeling again.

I understand the desire for a Jewish state after what occurred in WWII. I cannot comprehend how I would feel if my group of people were slaughtered the way Jewish people were. But is it wrong to criticize how the Israeli government and army runs? Palestinians have called Israel home for centuries, it does not make sense to oppress them. Innocent civilians are killed and there are tedious checkpoints, for what? How is that okay? I do not agree with the approach of the Justice for Palestinians group. The wall is aggressive and not pushing for a peaceful, respectful conversation. But I think if the Israeli government would stop placing numerous checkpoints in the West Bank, and would not go ham on Gaza whenever a few rockets fly over, and would recognize and treat Palestinians as equal citizens, maybe the situation would be better?  Thousands of Palestinians were literally forced out of their hometowns in order to help create Israel.

Yes I have more traits than just being a 'nice guy' that others do appreciate: giving, empathetic, strong valued, adventurous, ambitious, etc
I am more than looks and I know relationships are more than looks, however most of college culture (who are not religious, like me) cannot relate to me bc I don't go to parties, drink, etc.
These aspects are what I define as being a goodboi. I am more than just these traits still.
My point is that these traits are no longer appreciated in this society practically in college social life though they are voiced out, and it's sad for ppl like me who have been raised and built into this unwanted form.
And though you say that being a 'nice guy' is the most basic of human decency my point is that the vast majority of relationships do not have that requirement and tend towards acts that are currently against my values.
I'm not saying these confessions to gain pity (I have enough self pity) but rather to gain advice on how to move forward to be more socially/relationally wanted. Should I ammend my values? Start drinking etc? Start playing? Mold myself into a fuckboi? I don't know where to go.",,,

13326,2019-05-07 13:39:39,"Hello all, it‚Äôs the guy from #12948 again

Just wanted to take this opportunity to respond to #13048 (as well as anyone else who is curious) by saying that after about four days of deep introspection and retrospection about this I‚Äôve drawn roughly the same conclusions you‚Äôve drawn. 

First and foremost, I definitely should have been more proactive and vigorous in my efforts to getting to know her better and building up that bridge. Secondly, I also shouldn‚Äôt have waited 22 weeks to finally pop the question.

Truth be told, I have a rough and I think fairly accurate picture of what kind of person she is judging from what I‚Äôve seen (in person and through our org‚Äôs group chat) and what I‚Äôve been told by others. I didn‚Äôt mention this in my previous posts out of concerns for anonymity, but I fell for her not because she was just a very physically attractive lady (which was absolutely was), but because she was a passionate, patient, and caring soul with a big heart. She was someone who looked out for each and every one of us in the org no matter how well or little she knew us to make sure we were safe and sound (physically, mentally, and emotionally), someone who was a self-professed politics and military strategy nerd (which I find very neat, since I‚Äôm also a political/military/history buff) with a dark and sometimes morbid sense of humor (which I also really appreciate), and someone who doesn‚Äôt take shit from anyone else (which is probably the #1 reason why I fell for her; she was proud of who she was and comfortable with herself). 

Does all of this mean she definitely would‚Äôve been as good as I made her out to be? No, but she certainly piqued my interest to the point where I decided it was worth a shot. I may not have a solid answer on who she was precisely, but I had a rough and solid enough sketch, and I liked what I saw. 

Was I aware it could‚Äôve been a really short term relationship considering that she‚Äôs graduating in 4 weeks? Yes, but to be honest, even if we didn‚Äôt make it past June, at least it we would‚Äôve had those couple of months with each other, a couple of months of mutual happiness and companionship, and I think that‚Äôs pretty worthwhile too. As Lord Tennyson said, ‚ÄúTis better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all.‚Äù (Yeah, I admit I‚Äôm a bit of a hopeless romantic)

The reason I wasn‚Äôt more proactive with her, that I didn‚Äôt take more risks and fight like hell and allowed myself to just coast was because I saw her as my boss, essentially. She was my superior in my org and where I‚Äôm from, it is absolutely inappropriate to develop romantic feelings for your higher-ups. You maintained a courteous, professional, and somewhat distanced relationship with them and that was that. I struggled to fight this mindset throughout the five months we had known each other. I couldn‚Äôt convince myself that she wouldn‚Äôt be offended if I tried to get to know her better even when it was blatantly obvious that she wouldn‚Äôt (she had the org over at her place multiple times for drinks and party games and she joined in the fun with us). The whole concept just felt very foreign to me. In the end, I think it‚Äôs this mindset that caused me grief. I personally think I did have a shot with her, because from what I could tell, she and her boyfriend hooked up very recently. But I let my mind, which demanded strict respectful formality towards her at all times, prevail over my heart and common sense. Thus, I stopped myself from being bold with her and getting into a position where I could‚Äôve shot my shot sooner and preempted the rest of this story. Essentially, I was in the right place at the right time, originally, and then I simply stalled for far too long. 

Oh well. I should have done better, much better, but at least I was able to catch my mistakes from this time around, and that‚Äôs a pretty damn good consolation prize, if you ask me. 
I‚Äôve decided to put the focus back on myself again in the meanwhile. I‚Äôm trying to get back on top of classwork (I‚Äôve always been a first-class procrastinator, hahahaha) as well as trying to get back into the gym again (but it‚Äôs always so damn hard to find the time to do so, hahahaha). Life has gotten much better for me over these past few days, now that I‚Äôve made peace with myself over this whole episode.

I‚Äôm pleased to hear that my story touched you. I was not expecting the outpouring of sympathy and support that I got from the Confessions Community. I didn‚Äôt think so many of you would be interested in my story That genuinely took me by surprise and I am genuinely very deeply touched by that. Again, thank you all so very much.

13317,2019-05-07 11:56:06,"Tl;dr I Think i have developed mild depression from this shitty school.

After being here for two years, I have come to realize how sad it is just to be at UCSD.  I know that everyone describes this school as ""socially dead"" but its really been getting to me lately with just how depressing it is to be here. I'm writing this in biomed and i look around and all I see is people stuck to there computer screens looking at lecture slides or YouTube, waiting for their next exam. Its not even in libraries, its everywhere i go. People spend week after week studying to maintain their GPA because its ""so important to them"" and because the job market is so competitive now. Most teachers and students don't even seem to care about education, they only care about the end result (yes there are a few outliers, there are people here that enjoy their lives but from my perspective its a very select few). The more I look at it the more everyone to me looks so spineless; they only care about their grades, they only care about internships or career fairs, they don't even care if they like the shitty major their in (most people I've talked to hate their major or lie and say ""oh its interesting"" when they complain about it every other fucking second).

And i feel like ive become one of these people. Ive become a spineless slave to the american education system. and I know this sounds like a rant, ill probably get comments like ""Op, youre only saying this because youre not doing as well as you want to,"" but this is how i truly feel. I pretty much hide the fact that im depressed to my friends, family and my SO. I was fine in high school because it was so easy for me compared to college, but I feel as if all of my time and energy now is put into just passing my fucking classes. The more I think about it the more i feel like I don't belong here. I hate my major and Im only doing it for the money involved in my career path. The fact that I fail almost every test because of one question thats worth literally half of the test pisses me off because basing my GPA off of a few questions is a shit way to measure my knowledge. sometimes i feel like id rather work at a fucking Taco Bell than live a life where UCSD Administration is shitting on my mental health. This definitely isnt all I have to say, there's quite a lot that I'm irritated with at this school and its general student and faculty body (as im sure most of you are too) but I'll probably post it in a different confession post considering this one is too fucking long.",[redacted],"urgent, serious, sad",

He wasnt planning on using it immediately, just keeping it as sort of a peace of mind, but he's telling me now that he doesn't think he'll make it to the end of the week.

He has the philosophy that when someone wants to commit, they should be allowed to do so, but he hasn't really tried any treatments.

I was so shocked that I dropped my hot fucking pocket on the ground and he immediately said ‚Äúuhhh he borrowed my charger and I just came to get it‚Äù and I was like ‚Äúoooh ok so where is the charger??‚Äù And obviously there was no charger so he confessed that it‚Äôs been going on for a while now and basically asked me to keep it a secret.

13264,2019-05-06 21:39:16,"I'm a UCSD student, and I dated a guy for a few months who doesn't go to college at all. My ex was emotionally abusive throughout our whole relationship. I tried to end it after a month but it dragged on to over 6 fucking months because every time I tried to cut ties with him, he would either call the police and tell them I was suicidal or cut himself and claim he was depressed. It irks me so much because I've struggled with anxiety and depression for years, and whenever I broke up with him he'd pull the ""depression"" card to manipulate me into giving him attention despite never having a history of mental illness. I finally ended things after he anally raped me, after which he would post all these sadboy instagram stories about how he is now depressed and told everyone that I left him for another guy. I did find a great person and am in an amazing relationship with now, but that was 6 months after I tried to get away from his toxic ass. 

His sister went out of her way to dm me and attacked me for leaving her poor sweet little brother, who ""loved"" me so much, for another guy. Allegedly, I would also ""threaten to kill myself over him"" and he was better off without me. Honestly, its no surprise that he would whine and mope about the breakup to paint himself as a victim, but its infuriating for my mental health issues to be misappropriated in order to set me up as some crazy ex girlfriend, and its downright painful to be accused of these things when this guy is literally my abuser and my rapist. 

The worst part is that one of his best friends, who is a UCSD student, saw the abuse and actually helped me end the relationship -- yet he still hangs out with him and invites him to campus to smoke and skate. I always see him on social hanging out here and it just terrifies me that I might one day have to see him again.

Being hopelessly romantic sucks because I have so much love to give and a lot of people are just so great. How can you just pick one person to fall in love and spend your life with when there are plenty of fantastic people in the world that you can fall in love with? I'm not down with an open-relationship or any kind of polygamy so that's out of the question. I'll maybe try it out but it doesn't really appeal to me so probably not.

I just want to have romantic walks on the beach, hold hands, and embrace so many people. I'm not too into sex or anything since I'm asexual but I absolutely crave romance. I guess you can say that I'm in love with falling in love, heh. I always notice when I'm swooning, sighing, or daydreaming about people and I can't help but smile since the feeling of being flustered by love is so sublime, it fills me up with so much happiness and emotion that I have to scream into my pillow. The blood rushing to my face and my heart skipping a beat when thinking of or spending time with any of my crushes are two of the greatest feeling in the world.

I don't know if any of them caught on but I don't know what I'd do if I started dating someone again then start feeling love for someone that's not my partner. I don't think that I deserve anyone spending love on me because I can't spend mine on just them... I would never want to break someone's heart or hurt anyone because I can't control my emotions. I'd never physically or emotionally cheat on someone, I just don't know how my partner would react to how I feel for others. I don't think that they'd understand, I know that I don't understand myself most of the time. Would they be mad? Certainly they would be sad. What if the relationship ends sour because of my feeling for someone else? I don't ever want to put anyone through that.

Maybe I don't deserve to be loved myself, maybe I'm just selfish by choosing how to spend my love. I'm not entirely certain. Maybe the love that I constantly feel inside could be spent on just one person one day, I hope that's true, we'll just have to see. Maybe I just think that the feeling I have in droves is love and I never experienced true love. Just the thought of experiencing a feeling greater than what I feel now, especially for one person, makes me so excited and warm, it's probably the third greatest feeling. For now I will remain single and enjoy the feeling of loving everyone.

If I had a positive interaction with you, I might have some sort of crush on you. If I ask or find out your name, I probably have a crush on you. If we're friends and we hang out, I definitely have a crush on you. Romantic or platonic, I love you. Everyone is beautiful, don't get caught up too much about your looks. Personalities are much more easier to fall in love with (A genuine smile and pretty eyes are to die for though!! I love looking into someone else's eyes!!!!).

When I looked at the boards on Library Walk published my SJP I had an open mind. However, I feel that the boards on Library Walk are villanizing anyone who supports Israel's right to exist. Israel is meant to be a safe haven for an ethnoreligion that has been persecuted for thousands of years (and has been targeted within the San Diego area). Does that mean that I agree with all of Israel's policies regarding Palestine? The short answer is no, and the long answer is I don't feel informed enough about the issue from an unbiased standpoint to comprehensively judge Israel's policies. (Heck, I don't even feel like I can comprehensively judge American policies from an unbiased standpoint, but I still have an opinion about it.)
Also I think this is an unpopular opinion amongst people who are pro-Israel, but yes I do believe that Palestine deserves to exist as a country.

I won't get into the details but it was definitely sexual assault. Unconsensual sex. Maybe rape but I don't want to call it that for several reasons: I'm uncomfortable using that word, and my story ""isn't even that bad."" 
I wasn't hit, drugged or anything like that. In fact I was just starting to get to know him the few days before and he seemed really nice. That's the worst part though, and it doesn't make my experience any less valid. He is an otherwise ""nice guy"" and that's what he kept saying in order to convince me that he couldn't have possibly done it. 
You did do it, you vapid fucking bitch boy. You might be nice to your friends but when it came to me you treated me with with pure impulse and manipulation.
It makes me so mad when people doubt SA victims. ""Why didn't you report it happened?"" ""Oh there's no way [assaulter] could've done that, they're nice/shy/respected/etc."" I would be doubted too.
I didn't report it as soon as I could. I reaaallly wanted to rush to CVS to grab what I needed and get home ASAP so I could clean myself instead. Even after an hour long hot shower (sorry momma earth) I felt vile. Fuck you for making me feel like that for such a long time.

13060,2019-05-05 02:28:42,"Last fall quarter, I met this girl. I didn't think anything about it at the time, I thought we just hit if off really well as friends. She told me she's bi, but I didn't think much of it.

But a few weeks pass, and I start to develop feelings for her. I was so sure I was straight, I had never been so confused in my life. I tried to pretend for a few months, but one night I just couldn't lie to myself anymore. I'm still confused on my sexuality, but I know for sure I like this girl.

I tried to dismiss my feelings because I know my family won't be supportive, and I don't like standing out in a crowd. But it was absolutely impossible. I had never fallen for anyone this hard before. NEVER, not even to the slightest degree. And the feelings only grew stronger as I got to know her better. We were really good friends, and sometimes I thought I got signals from her. Guess I was wrong, though.

Over winter break, I confessed my feelings. Her first reaction was to ask me if I was sure, and my heart fell. She basically told me that it wasn't a good time for her, that she still needed to figure some things out. I, of course, respected that. A few weeks later I asked her about it in person. tl;dr she said that she doesn't not like me but also added that she doesn't know when she'll be ""better"" mentally to start a relationship (but she didn't tell me exactly what the issue was), that it might take a few months or a few years. Me being infatuated with her, I told her I'd wait.

Even though we both agreed to remain friends, things just haven't been quite normal since. I fell into the most depressive state in my life I've ever been, questioning my feelings, questioning why this had to happen to me, of all people. It was almost as if it was worse than if she had just flat out told me that she didn't like me back. And I hadn't realized that I had, for so many months, depended on this girl for my happiness. Get through studying for this test, I would tell myself, and you can hang with her afterwards.

I knew I needed to get over her, knew that I needed to be okay with being alone. And now, a few months later, I'm glad to say that I'm better. I still love this girl, but I'm in a much better mental state. The only problem is that whenever I see her, all I feel is sad. The jittery feeling I once felt every time I saw her had been replaced by a tremendous heap of just plain old sadness.

And just today when we were in a group, she said she doesn't like banking on the idea that one day she'll find her someone. I don't know if she said that purposely, or if she thinks I've gotten over her.

Either way, I haven't. I still dream of us having a future only to stop myself and feel like absolute shit and all gross on the inside. It would probably be easier if I stop being friends with her altogether, but I feel like that would just be a dick move, and our mutual friends (who don't know this is happening) would definitely know something is up.

Anyways, I've left out some plot details because they pose too great of a risk in ruining my anonymity, but this is the gist of what has happened.

You also mentioned she was graduating, so even if she did say yes there was no guarantee anything wouldve worked out after this coming June. The right person will come around eventually. Rather than focus on getting a girlfriend, focus on how YOU can be a better boyfriend, and work towards those qualities.

This is a university. Be an adult. Step up and be assertive. Whether changes happen or not is ultimately up to the club, but at least you can say, ""I tried,"" instead of sitting behind a screen like a coward. Just be brave. It might seem scary at first, but it shows that you care and that you're a mature, responsible adult. Plus, you get to praise yourself later for taking progressive action.

For me Cinco de Mayo is truly a day to celebrate. Few people have come to know the ‚Äútrue‚Äù story of the origin of Cinco de Mayo. It is my pleasure to set the record straight.

A little known fact is that back in 1912, Hellmann‚Äôs mayonnaise was manufactured in England. In fact, the Titanic was carrying 12,000 jars of the condiment scheduled for delivery in Vera Cruz, Mexico, which was to be the next port of call for the great ship after its stop in New York. This would have been the largest single shipment of mayonnaise ever delivered to Mexico but as we know, the great ship did not make it to New York.

The ship hit an iceberg and sank and the cargo was forever lost. The people of Mexico, who were crazy about mayonnaise and were eagerly awaiting its delivery, were disconsolate at the loss. Their anguish was so great, that they declared a National Day of Mourning which they still observe to this day.

12948,2019-05-03 17:37:34,"Hello team! It's the guy from #12478 (and also #12266, #11152, #9578, and #9299; yeah, I polled this group a lot haha) and I'm here to give you guys the results of me shooting my shot (as some folks requested).

So I met her at Geisel today (a day late due to scheduling conflicts) to inform her that I was leaving the org that we are both a part of (for totally unrelated reasons). I had planned to save asking her out on a date until the end of that brief chat. During the course of this conversation, she went on about her hectic midterm schedule and how the week has been for her thus far. 

Then she said, ""I had planned to meet up with my boyfriend, but then we couldn't, because I was so busy.""

And then my heart shattered into a million pieces.

We had known each other for five months, and in all the time that I've known her, she's never brought him up in any way until now. This was the first time I have ever heard of her boyfriend. (Although admittedly, I felt in my bones for the longest time that she may be taken, and oh, how it hurts for your worst fears to finally be realized).

So with all that in mind, I chose to end our conversation with a simple farewell and not pop the question or even reveal my true feelings about her, since I felt that would've been wrong and disrespectful and immature and undignified.

What is getting me mad and depressed now wasn't anything she did. She did nothing wrong. I'm not mad at myself either. I have concluded that I did everything I possibly could given what I was given. What's getting me is the fact that this is the third woman in a row I've had a major crush who turned out to be already taken when I pop the question. 

I've never had a girlfriend before and fate is making it soul-crushingly hard for me to find one. I've never ever had a fair shot when it came to shooting my shot (that is, I've never got to ask out someone who was single at the time of my asking). Now, I understand that them's the breaks and that's just how things turn out sometimes, but it still doesn't stop me from getting mad about it (and I'm sure a number of you can sympathize with that sentiment).

I don't look for casual hookups or just sex or anything of that nature. I want something that is meaningful and deep and real with someone that's kindly and mature and sensitive and fun. Consequently, I'm somewhat picky with the people that I crush on. So I've never had very many crushes on people (two in the past two years).

I'm trying as hard as I can to keep the negative thoughts away, the thoughts of worthlessness and being completely undateable and the like (as well as the typical thoughts of ""Oh, I'll never find anyone quite like her"" that I typically have around this time). But it's hard to feel like you're worthy of someone or someone will ever be interested in you or you'll ever find someone when the powers that be keep leading you to wonderful women who are taken. It truly makes you wonder what the fuck you did to deserve something like this.

There's also a bittersweet finality to all of this. I've crushed on her for five months and now all of that planning and hopes and dreams and preparation is done. It's all over, and I feel this great emptiness in my heart.

(If you're wondering why I didn't ask earlier, it was because there were conflicting commitments on Sun God weekend (to her and the rest of our org) that I had to fulfill and it would not have been appropriate if I asked before those commitments were fulfilled. It might've made things quite awkward, so I'm happy I held off from that.)

If any of you have any tips on how to move on from the pain that I feel in my heart right now (or words of encouragement or advice or anything of that nature), then please do let me know, because I don't want to resort to anything stupid and potentially dangerous like drinking the pain away.

So yeah, that's the thrilling conclusion of that story.

Confessions community, thank you so very much for all the support and advice that you have given me (as well as anything you'll give me now in the comments section here). I read through every single comment you put on my posts and took them to heart. You really are a magnificent bunch.

And so, to end this post, I just want to say this:
""If you're reading this (and you know who you are), well now you know how I feel about you and what kind of state I'm in now. But please don't worry about me. Things like this happen. It's all a part of the natural cycle of life and I will recover and move on from it. I still stand by every single thing I said to you today on the third floor of Geisel, how much of a lovely person you are and how it's people like you make the world a better place for us all. I earnestly hope that your boyfriend counts his blessings each and every day for having someone as wonderful as yourself in his life. I don't know if our paths will cross again in the future, but if it doesn't, I wish you nothing but the very best of luck (not that you'll really need it) as well as success and happiness wherever you go in whatever you do. Godspeed and thank you for everything.""",,update very long,

I can't tell my partner about this because I think they'd freak. I can't tell my friend because the outcome of that is awkwardness whether the feelings are mutual or not. I should confide in a friend that isn't within that circle. But other than polygamy (nothing wrong with that) I cant think of another viable solution, than to just keep my mouth shut and hope it passes. But I've held crushes for 3 years before and that was shit. ",,sad,

Having to work my ass off to get here as a first-gen student only to have to compete with obnoxiously cliquey racist east asian international students who cheat to get by is bullshit and it sucks that this isn't being addressed better by the administration. Add to it, that I personally believe a lot of the ""socially dead"" aspect of this school can be attributed to that demographic of students, just leaves no good-will towards them. This is obviously not the case for every east asian international student, the ones I have had the pleasure to actually socialize with, without being seen a lesser poor brown person, have been very friendly and good people. It may be bad that I am generalizing the entirety of that population, but in my personal experience, they've been shitholes 9 time out of 10.

I‚Äôve been dealing with it for a very long time but never went to a psychiatrist or psychologist. Just a high school counselor who was of no help to me. 

Having to deal with anxiety is such a horrible thing. I‚Äôve dealt with it since I was 12. And I‚Äôm surprised I‚Äôve made it this far because dealing with suicidal thoughts was also another thing that pops in with anxiety. People say ‚Äújust do something to get your mind off of it‚Äù well I played a sport most of my life, played a musical instrument, was part of ASB, was part of the top 10% of my class...well nothing worked. So it‚Äôs not as easy to ignore it. I could be having the best time and then out of no where I lose it....

To those that don‚Äôt know what people with anxiety go thru...where here‚Äôs what happens to me atleast....I constantly wonder if I even need to keep on with college because I doubt I‚Äôll make it to my PhD (but that‚Äôs just my anxiety talking), I always tend to say sorry even when it‚Äôs not my fault because it feels like everything is my fault. Some times I feel like everything is a dream and I‚Äôm just watching everything and everyone go thru with life behind a window. When I get anxiety attacks...I start feeling out of place as if no one wants me around which causing me to want to be alone so I go to my room or somewhere alone...then the shaking starts..an uncontrollable shaking.. then i can even feel the blood going thru my veins as I start hyperventilating. I swear I try to breathe but nothing works it feels like there‚Äôs no oxygen for me to breathe in....then at that point where I‚Äôm just sitting in the corner feeling horrible it gets worse...I start hearing (remembering) things that people would tell me. Whenever a mean coach would yell and tell me I sucked well that would come to mind...whenever my mom would yell at me call me stupid and that I won‚Äôt make it well that would come to mind...Everything. You just hear everything and it just all attacks you at once. Then you get a feeling inside you that you want to scream so loud but you can‚Äôt because you don‚Äôt want anyone else to hear.

Most international student's don't even stay in the U.S after graduation to work and stimulate our economy. Most go back to China, Korea, India, Saudi Arabia--flaunt their U.S degrees, work in their home country, stimulate their economies, all the while us Americans take the hit.

- make a bipedal first form so when the design is initially released people will think it‚Äôs gonna be fire/fighting based on the tiniest detail

12685,2019-05-01 21:24:57,"I understand how people say stuff like you can‚Äôt really find something ‚Äúreal-real‚Äù on tinder and the very fact that someone needs a dating app to meet people is in itself a ‚Äúred flag‚Äù regarding their possible hidden issues. BUT ya‚Äôll can‚Äôt just be going all ‚Äúdon‚Äôt approach girls‚Äù and then bitch about ‚Äúwhy can‚Äôt I connect with anyone in rl‚Äù.

I am not the type to join orgs and clubs because I am simply not interested and even when I do go to ‚Äúevents‚Äù, guys rarely approach me. They do stare though, as if your glare is enough for me to wet my panties. It is not. I need an intellectual conversation, an emotional connection, and at least a dozen of solid jokes from you‚Ä¶then I‚Äôm all yours. I‚Äôm obviously joking btw, but low-key high-key feel free to print a pack of memes/jokes and give them to me if you see me in public. 

Now, I don‚Äôt have an issue getting matches and meeting people from tinder. I usually meet about 5 guys a month when I‚Äôm bored and want some ‚Äúmale attention‚Äù. I think it is a fucking great tool in 21st century because guys don‚Äôt have the balls anymore (or maybe just in Cali) and this page is a damn proof. I have nothing against the page per se (love it and love ya‚Äôll) BUT c‚Äômon we all fucking know the difference between being a creep and being a normal guy approaching someone. 

What I am saying is that there were a few posts about ‚Äúdo you girls wanna be approached more‚Äù and some comments were like ‚Äúnah, stay away dude‚Äù. WELL. As a subjectively relatively attractive female (according to tinder statistics and my friends), BY ALL FUCKING MEANS APPROACH. 

Approach people in your classes, people you sit next to, people in line for coffee. Ask to borrow pens, ask academic questions, ask for directions. Be creative. How? Honestly test the waters and try different neutral pick up lines . Say ‚Äúyou have a nice perfume‚Äù or ‚ÄúI like your shoes‚Äù while in line for a coffee or after a class. I usually compliment guys on their outfit because none of ya‚Äôll use nice cologne :( which is actually sad because male cologne is fucking bae‚Ä®‚Ä®

So yeah, if the reaction is positive (aka the girl doesn‚Äôt give you a death stare), proceed to ask for an ‚Äúadvice‚Äù. A question is all it takes. Asking for ‚Äúhelp‚Äù is like a solid strategy when you want to get something. You are giving the other person a sense of ‚Äúpower‚Äù over the situation‚Äî this applies to life in general. ‚ÄúBy the way, do you happen to know where the room/building/etc is?‚Äù. Be nice/smiley and bring ‚Äúpositive energy‚Äù. Don‚Äôt overdo it and come off ‚Äúneedy/clingy‚Äù though. The initiative should (ideally) come from a girl, because this would increase the chances of a successful contact exchange. 

What I am trying to say is that for me personally there is simply not enough OPPORTUNITY for interactions with guys around me, which is why I use tinder and enjoy it for literally ‚Äúmeting new people‚Äù. Like yeah, I‚Äôm probably (read: definitely) not gonna like it when a guy is clearly ‚Äúeyeing‚Äù me and has a ‚Äúthirsty‚Äù look (yes! some of you do) BUT, what I would greatly appreciate is a sense of ‚Äúcreating room for interaction‚Äù, where, if I want.. I can take the conversation further.

I am just fucking TIRED approaching guys on my own because I‚Äôm traditional that way, so what. 

AND GOOD LUCK ON YOUR EXAMS YA‚ÄôLL!

Ill be honest, where i come from doesn't have many black people. theres only latinx and Koreans. But lemme tell you my friends and I, both hispanic and asian... we both struggle lmao. 
We definitely face different types of discrimation, but its discrimination nonetheless. To me it seems like there are equal number of successful hispanic and korean business owners and equal number of hispanics and koreans who struggle. 
Let me tell you, most of my asian friends from back home have it WAY worse economically than some of my black and hispanic friends here. 
Take my own family for example. My mom had to work under the table for less than minimum wage for most of my life as a single mom until the Obama administration did all that shit for us which applies to both koreans and hispanics. The same can be said for almost all my asian friends back home. 
I feel all yall. Al lot of the asian friends i made in college come from pretty nice families compared to where i come from lol. But that doesnt mean were all rich. 
In fact, the poverty rate for asian americans is actually higher than the national average. 
I remember freshman year when we (both hispanic and korean) all met up during winter break, we laughed our asses off about how much we struggled in our childhood compared to our new peers since we had NO FUCKING IDEA how much we actually struggled LOL. 
I have a few asian friends from back home who are well off, but i also have a few hispanic friends back home who come from families just as well off. 
For both communities, majority of us came to the states on a visa. And for both, a few of us came illegally through the border. Idk if yall know, but in the 90s, quite a few koreans had to fly to argentina and then go to mexico and then finally LA.

To me, it makes absolutely no sense how forming an arbritrary agreement with one person prevents you from feeling attraction towards another. ***Your body does not ""know"" you agreed to be exclusive to someone, so being unable to form new romantic feelings towards another person makes absolutely no sense***. I think what's more likely is once someone is cuffed they spend majority of their time and social energy on that one person so other people do not seem attractive not because of choice, but because of the nature of relationships and the amount of time and social energy spent with one's S/O. Consider this: John and Jane are in a relationship with one another. Jane moves to another State for grad school. There she meets Brian, someone who is kind, attractive, funny, smart, definitely everything she wants in an S/O, and they start spending enormous amounts of time together. You're telling me that she wouldn't once consider having a relationship with him instead of John? Because of what? The ""forces of love""? I don't think so.

Y'all also have the audacity to say that KP is not a party org.  but then y'all encourage the upper classmen to get all the first years drunk af and get them wasted every fucking social. 

Also, KP is just a bunch of posers. If you dont drink or know how to ""get lit"" a lot of the board members and general members of the org. dont even bother to get to know you. So your pretty much just stuck hanging out with your fam (which for me was not too bad since my fam is pretty dope)

With that said, I still love KP but y'all need to get your shit together.",[redacted],"trigger warning, serious",

12751,2019-04-30 16:25:01,"Sun God diary, figured this would be a good therapeutic exercise and some people might relate. I didn't have a group of people who I made plans with, so I went alone, figuring I would see some of my friends. I run into a couple people from a club after a half hour of wandering and chill with them for a bit, keeping me busy. They eventually split apart and I bump into a buddy from another org, who says we should stick together. They're not the type of person who would get on me for being a bit of a downer, so I start to feel more comfortable. I eventually run into my bestie after Joji's set and we hang out for a bit, until I decided to go further into the crowd during Vince's set to jam. Didn't know anyone and it seemed like a lot of people were out of it or had little experience with rap shows, so I go back out to find my group. My last crush walks past me as I anxiously look around for my friend, giving a quick wave. This made me feel happy, but also kind of taken aback and the ""it was an awkward acknowledgement, they're not happy to see you"" thought quickly begins to run on repeat. I cry for a minute and come to the realization that my bestie probably dipped. I go into the mosh pit on a whim and wind up having a good time, elbow to the jaw notwithstanding. As I leave, the synagogue tragedy news is the first thing I see on my phone, immediately turning the high from the pit into a feeling of grief and resigned disgust (Jew in Trumpland here.) I get some food after not eating for seven hours and another crying fit comes on. I can tell that nobody is looking, so I just let it happen. I find a bit of relief and briefly chuckle about the fact that I'm crying while shoveling down fries. Within a few minutes, that chuckle turns into an ""oh fuck, this is where I'm at now"" realization. I get a ""u okay"" text from my dad, which he usually sends if I forget to respond to his messages for a bit. My phone battery is at 1%, so I don't respond, again. I get back to my apartment and sit on the couch, thinking nobody is home. I start to hear the sounds of puking a minute later and begin weeping profusely, running to my room. Saw some old friends later on that night and enjoyed myself, perking up my mood overall. I might have had another cry before I went to sleep, could have been a different night though. I generally feel like I'm on the outside looking in and SG proved to be no different, but I knew that would probably be the case going into it. I put myself out there in situations where I feel like a fish out of water because I know it will benefit me in the long run, and still ultimately enjoyed myself more than I thought I would. 3/5",,long,

12632,2019-04-30 13:46:12,"Dear Obnoxiously Loud People in the Library and Study Areas at UCSD,

I write to you all to earnestly ask that you all be more respectful of your fellow students with whom you are sharing the area with. 

I understand that the library (the non-quiet area) and study areas are not quiet study zones so some talking is okay. I mean I do it too. But the noise level is just amazing loud - I can hear you all talking even though I have my noise cancelling headphones on.

I understand that some people are teaching and helping their friends with materials from class and that's totally cool. However, you're not the only ones using the area. 

Like I said before, these areas are a communal, shared areas so, though conversing is okay (especially near Audrey's) but can we all be a bit more considerate of others and talk quietly (remember from grade school ""indoor/library voices""?), not have loud conversations on the phone and keep the loud laughing and horse playing to a minimum? 

Now, you may say, ""If you don't like the noise, then go to the quiet areas upstairs"" or that these silence-longing students ought to study elsewhere but that just defeats the purpose of a library. Furthermore, the upper levels can be full and therefore not always possible.

This applies to the study rooms as well. They're called ""study rooms"" and not a ""lounge"" for a reason.

As an esteemed Berkeley student once said, ""Hey! Hey! Hey! This is library!"" (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHhy2Gk_xik for your reference for those who don't get the reference).

Again, please be courteous of your fellow students trying to study.

Sincerely,

A Fellow UCSD Student Trying to Study in Peace",,"""hey! this is library""!",

12733,2019-04-30 01:36:13,"In my sociology class my prof was talking about the medicalization of deviance and brought up ADHD. She asked if anyone had been diagnosed, and the two other people who spoke about it said they overall had negative experiences with medication and stopped taking it. I shared that i experience some negative side effects, but overall the benefits far outweigh the side effects. She proceeded to talk about how ADHD is essentially how kids act anyway and that everyone could take a pill and act super human if they were given one. I definitely understand the idea that ADHD is being diagnosed more and more, and how it's only really a diagnosis because those diagnosed don't work well in the societal environment that has been created, but I just felt like she was dismissive of the real struggle it can be. I hated myself and thought I was a lazy idiot for years until I got treated for ADHD. I still like her as a proof, but that was a bit frustrating.",,"trigger warning, mental illness",

12729,2019-04-30 01:13:17,"No one cares. The thought that echoes in my mind every morning when I wake, when I brush my teeth, when I go to school, and until I drift into the emptiness at night. To realize that it‚Äôs no one‚Äôs responsibility to care is a heart shattering realization. To know that you‚Äôre falling deeper and deeper into a pit and know that any one of the people you‚Äôre falling past could reach out and pull you back into the safety of love, acceptance, and empathy. Maybe they don‚Äôt know you‚Äôre suffering. Maybe they‚Äôre not paying attention. Maybe they have their own problems to figure out. Maybe they realize how much of a burden it is to be your friend and it‚Äôs easier to avoid. Regardless of the reason, the truth is that you‚Äôre alone. Alone with your thoughts, alone with your feelings, alone with your cares and desires in this world. 

This sense of loneliness compounds with every glance at a kissing couple, friends laughing, etc. You ask yourself why other people have friends, have significant others, have love, acceptance, have fun, and the only rationale explanation is that you weren‚Äôt chosen. This feeling of being the last one picked, the odd one out, is something you‚Äôve become all too familiar with. From gym class and teams in middle school to projects in college, the polite ones glance down to avoid eye-contact or say, ‚ÄúUmmm, I‚Äôm actually already with x.‚Äù You realize pretty quickly that you‚Äôve been standing for too long, left out hanging. Your body squirms with the discomfort from the gaze of others. Your entire existence is skipped over until the silence of the second last person being picked and you slowly drag yourself over to the other team. Last picked alludes to some notion of being chosen when that couldn‚Äôt be further from the truth. You weren‚Äôt chosen. An unlucky team or person was stuck with you. You‚Äôre given to someone who doesn‚Äôt want you, like an ad placed in your mailbox or more adeptly a parking ticket stuck onto someone‚Äôs windshield. You didn‚Äôt choose this life of torment and yet it was likewise thrust upon you.

You ask yourself where did it all go wrong? How could you be born into this world like everyone else yet end up so different, so far from everyone else? Everyone‚Äôs origin story is different. Mine began in middle school. Before, I felt like I was just another kid for the most part. Things changed when I was evicted from my elementary school and forcibly placed into middle school. I was warned that the school might be a bad culture fit. Like the naive kid I was, I didn‚Äôt give it much thought. The message that I was unwanted was slowly bled into my mind. From the teachers to the students, it was made clear that no one wanted me there. I didn‚Äôt belong. I wasn‚Äôt white. I wasn‚Äôt rich. I didn‚Äôt play club sports. I didn‚Äôt wear Quick Silver, Hurley, or the stereotypical clothes from other students. A memory etched eternally in my mind is returning to class after lunch and since all the boys played outside, we were all sweaty and dirty. My eighth grade teacher greeted each of them with a smile but that smile quickly vanished when her eyes laid on me. ‚ÄúGo clean yourself up, you look absolutely disgusting‚Äù still echoes in my mind and the feeling of being lesser than are still branded in mind with a wound as fresh as the day those hot iron words struck my ears. This realization wasn‚Äôt something that happened overnight. It was like most things in this world, slow and steady. You begin as a flat grassy field with just a small trickle of disgust and disdain for your existence trickling through and before you know it, you‚Äôre left with a huge hole in your existence, a giant grand canyon of with thunderous waves of anxiety, depression, and self-loathing.

Time passes and the people around you change. You change schools and eventually leave to a different city for college. Your tormentors and peers long forget about you with you being a distant memory ever shrinking in their rear view mirror as they drive toward their rest, discovering the fruits of life, things that make things worth living, friends, love, and success. You cough as the dust spun up by the tires catches in your throat and eventually they fade from your view. But they‚Äôve left their mark upon you forever. What was outside and external, these thoughts of not being accepted, of being ugly, of not being good enough have slowly but surely seeped through the pores of your skin and now have corrupted your mind. They don‚Äôt need to be there to say it anymore because your mind already says it for them. You don‚Äôt need to hear the laughter from others when they make fun of your feelings on a crush, you now tell yourself, no, you know that you‚Äôre not good enough. Undeserving of love. Undeserving of affection. Undeserving of friendship. Filled with rage at yourself for being stupid enough to think that you could ever have those things you saw others enjoy. The hand of life slaps your childlike hands away from the candy at the supermarket checkout counter like a scolding mother. 

How many bad days does it take to change you a person? To corrupt what one was good, kind, and loving into something cynical? Maybe every rejection, every mean jab ever made, maybe every hurtful thing is like a stab to your heart until the skin scars and hardens. How many more days can you take before you decide it's preferable to die and kill yourself rather than go on another day locked inside of your mind, your life? What will be the final thing that breaks you so utterly and completely you lose all hope for life? Do you know what or when it will be or does it strike from nowhere? I know not the answers to these questions but am afraid I may find out the answer soon.

12606,2019-04-30 01:12:25,"I see so many posts about being lonely. About desiring companionship, or maybe just company for a night. And while I might empathize both of these sentiments to some extent, what I really crave is someone who can provide something more enthralling than my solitude. I've experienced significant others with extreme love and depth. I've have friends with benefits. I've been in relationships lasting years that I thought I could share a life long companionship with. (I should say, I went to college late, and as such grad school late, so had the time to accumulate such experiences). Through all of this, the one take away is - that we learn about ourselves through others. Whether its as simple as learning about our romantic preferences, or learning the darkest parts of ourselves through the sordid experiences that only the depths of connecting with another human can inspire and teach.

I no longer wish for a passionate lust that leaves me insatiable daily, and not even a stable and sustainable love that might provide the comforting, complacent, but nurturing quality that becomes the norm in a long term relationship. I know myself, as much as one can, until we decipher more.

I just want someone whom I can share some of my vulnerable feelings and thoughts with (including the gravity of all the context and history behind it), and they can respond with ""I get it."" Someone who might be able to come to know me how I've come to know myself. ",,serious,

12696,2019-04-29 21:18:17,So this is a cautionary tale about how I hit a car at Trader Joe‚Äôs back in February but it‚Äôs been haunting me since. I tried to park into one of those tiny parking spots and I hit (scratched) a car.  It was like almost 10pm and the driver of the car I hit was in the car. It was 100% my fault and I was ready to exchange my insurance info and whatnot. Stuff got weird when he gave me the option to pay him $200 cash or make a police/insurance report. I had no cash on me and so I told him I‚Äôd rather do an insurance claim. He started getting really pushy about me ‚Äúgiving him a number‚Äù (cash) so that I wouldn‚Äôt have to make an insurance claim. It kinda felt like extortion. I should note that he was an older Asian man which makes it weird since he finally left me alone after he asked me simply ‚Äúare you a student? Do you you speak Spanish?‚Äù To which I answered yes and he was like NVM FORGET ABOUT IT and left. I still made a police report afterwards just in case it was reported as a hit and run but a lot of people told me it might‚Äôve been a scam. Please be careful out there everyone üòî,,"serious, potential scams",

12546,2019-04-29 16:38:53,"Wake me up

I need a wake up call from my internet anonymous friends. 
So I've been in a long term relationship since HS to undergrad and now through masters. Since I am earning my masters in ucsd, the relationship became long distance.
Over the past year, as my girl has been working and traveling, our connection fell short. Her personality changed a bit mostly due to working environment, became a bit more commanding, type A stuff. Her interests shifted into photography, Instagram fame, tinder, thrill seeking... I mean, I know, tinder is already a red flag. I went clear with her about my opinions on dating applications, and she insists and promises that it is for sole usages to get followers(???). Idk man, don't ask me. Partly maybe just because she's lonely and in need of attention? Dude the logic is a mess, anyway, an exclusive simple relationship was my request. 
Anyhow, we had verbal arguments. I felt unloved and discarded. I realized how much has changed over the past year. I don't think I've changed much, video games, exercise, food, talking over phone, work grinding cycle seems fairly balanced to me. fuck im drifting away from topic. Knowing her past well, I can understand the reason for who she's become today. But at the same time, my unrequited love and affection had me in some agony. It felt like loving a stranger who you once knew, FeelsBadMaN.
After graduating, I will be heading back home for M.D. degree, which is a few states away from her. Asked her if she'd like to come back, she said she is content with current workplace so give her a year to make some savings. I feel that I am slowly losing grip of this relationship. Even if we keep on to have ourselves to be loyal to each other, we don't quite click anymore. It's hard to be exciting or flirty when your partner isn't in the mood. I don't remember what I was going to ask for in the first place. I'm just a bit sad and intoxicated. 

If you kindly may, gimme some inputs or suggestions on what to do.
Undoubtedly, I have a privileged and loving life which I am thankful for.  If a seven years relationship fails, ggs go next I guess, what can ya do, hell isn't breaking loose. Just all this sad boi thoughts had me in need of confessing. So I guess that makes you some type of internet confession booth Father, or Mommy? 

Anyways, pour me another.

12474,2019-04-29 11:13:56,"Smash Ultimate Stage Builder Guide

Alright so I've had around like 10 hours of experience with the new Smash Ultimate Stage Builder so I've decided to make a guide for people who are new and wanna try shit out so they don't have to spend the first few hours figuring everything out.

Basics
1) The Grid.  Press Y and check the grid near the bottom left.  It'll make keeping the stage symmetrical a million times easier.

2) Highlighting.  You can drag a square to select multiple objects at once which makes it possible to move things around at the same time.  

3) Layers.  There's 4 layers: back-background, background, stage, and foreground.  You can change one you're drawing in by pressing Y then selecting the layer you want.  

4) L button. Press the L button to draw a straight line if you're in free hand, a square if you're in rectangle mode, and a circle if you're in ellipse mode.

5) Undo button.  Instead of tapping the undo button on the top left every time you make a mistake, just press the left button on the D-pad.  Make it a habit.

Terrain
6) Bouncing rubber.  Bouncing rubber does not make you bounce or jump higher.  However falling objects do bounce off of it.

7) Lava. Lava is technically a terrain.  Keep this in mind in the future.

8) Falling objects.  You can select a block of terrain and it opens a menu that allows you to turn on gravity.  This means the block will fall instead of floating in the air like an actual stage. 

9) Circles.  Circular objects WILL roll on an incline if they fall on one.  

Hazards
9) Bomb/Explosive Blocks.  Bomb/explosive blocks do no damage.  Bomb blocks basically exist to active explosive blocks to create destructible terrain.

10) Hazards + Terrain.  The most important note in this guide: pretty much everything else is just buildup.  So, hazards such as cannons and bumpers are fixed on the map.  However if a hazard is attached to Terrain with Gravity turned on, then it  falls with the terrain.  So you can essentially create a falling bumper/cannon by attaching it to a small piece of terrain with the gravity turned on.  

Other
11) Switches.  Switches do not activate bomb/explosive blocks.  They work by activating/inactivating the gear attached to the terrain they are on. 

12) Gears + Gravity.  If you turned on the gravity for terrain to make a falling object but then attach a gear, that object becomes fixed in the air again.  So basically you can't create a turning object that falls.   

13) Save online stages.  Even though Nintendo bans ""inappropriate"" stages, people still post them.  If you see a good stage, save it before it gets taken down!

fast forward to the same shift. at work sometimes the pro staff there get to do workshops/presentations for students. at the end people who went get to do a review on the speaker. one student in their review went OFF on how ‚Äúunprofessional‚Äù and ‚Äúunengaged‚Äù my boss was during an activity. when i saw that scathing review and thought back to what my boss told me literally hours before, i wanted to laugh so hard. my boss is such a fucking hypocrite and all the criticism they gave me earlier that shift is so questionable now",,,

But in reality I just do not give a fuck about student leadership and professionalism the staff there always preaches. I see the entirety of the professional staff there as people who did not figure out what they wanted to do after college, so they decided to just work for university instead claiming a career in ‚ÄúStudent Advising‚Äù or ‚ÄúStudent Leadership‚Äù or some BS. I doubt any sane person ever went to undergrad and thought to themselves ‚ÄúI wish I had a major or career path that will literally never let me leave college ever again!‚Äù

I gotten to the point where I break so many rules and lie to all the staff all the time because the work is a load of crap and there‚Äôs literally no reason why not to break the rules if it means making my job easier (I also do it in spite of how dumb the rules are). I‚Äôm so numb to how much it‚Äôs actually affecting my job there, but I could care less because my coworkers also do not genuinely care about the students they serve half of the time anyways, despite it being in their job descriptions. The departments like mine claim to ‚Äúenhance the student experience‚Äù when half of the time you are degraded and treated like shit BECAUSE you are a dumb student.

It wasn‚Äôt always like this for me. I am a VP of a mid sized social/fun org and it‚Äôs so liberating to be grassroots and just put on events and build a small community. No managers that are breathing down your neck. No dumb policies to abide to. No working with people who don‚Äôt care. Just working with other students to bring a fun event. That‚Äôs the student leadership I live for and is why I initially thought this job I applied for would feel like. But when I have to do similar stuff for work, there‚Äôs no passion or emotion behind the projects and events my department puts on. Because it‚Äôs run by staff who need to fill an arbitrary quota and enforce stupid policies during the planning and executions of the event. And no matter how good or bad it goes they get a paycheck anyways.

Yes, that was a shitty move on my part.

And uh.. long story short Girlfriend #1 blocked me on everything and never talked to me again, which really I don't blame her for.

Skipping past all the emotional guilt/unhealthy coping mechanisms that persisted through 6 months of my next relationship, I still feel incredibly guilty. Looking back too, she tried to reach out to me multiple times after the breakup so we could connect and catch up, but I was always busy with school, and.. I just regret everything?

It's two years down the line, and I'm still finding myself dwelling on something that happened way in past, when I've already made my peace, and I don't really understand?

I just think back to how utterly shitty I made her feel, and how I completely cut off a wonderful person from my life forever because I was a dumbass who couldn't control his dick. We made plans before she left to meet up again, and how we were even going to be at eachothers' weddings, and I just ruined everything. Jesus man, that shit comes back to me at night sometimes and it really just fucks me up.

Is it ever really supposed to go away?

I've spent alot of time making my peace with it so I could fully love Girlfriend #2, and I thought I did, but after Breakup #2, that shit just pops out on quiet nights (during Joji too actually), and I don't really know what to do with myself?

I'm not simping after my ex, I just feel like an incredibly shitty person because of what I've done, and of an important person that I've lost.

Saying the truth means so much more to me than anyone can ever imagine (By speaking the truth I do not include being rude and straight up pointing things out or calling someone out. I do believe sometimes you can't speak the truth to be considerate of the person, which depends on the environment and the concept which gets complicated. I just mean straight up lying about something here). My boyfriend, despite knowing how much I value the truth, has lied to me about something over the course of our entire relationship and only told me now after we've been dating for about 6 or 7 months. Almost a year since we've met. I did not know what to do when he told me and it was through text, the night before my midterm when I was studying. Because of this I ended up pulling an all-nighter trying to study while the shock was in my mind and ended up passing out at a commuter lounge. Besides all that, I made an exception and gave my boyfriend a second chance because I really love him. Now here's where things gets a little complicated. Since then, I've unintentionally started to emotionally abuse my boyfriend (i realized this, and he knows it too). By unintentionally, I stopped sharing things as much and did alot of things that were described on articles describing an emotionally abuse relationship and later realized that these are actually a part of an abusive relationship. Despite knowing that, my boyfriend decides to stay with me because he told me that he loves me. A part of me hated doing this because I know it is morally wrong, but the other part of me feels like  he deserved at least some of it because he knew how lying impacts me and how much I values the truth, but decides to lie anyways. I have multiple evidence of he telling me that he's never lied to me and never will, just to later on find out that he was lying making these lies as well. During the course of the ""emotional abuse"", he blames himself that this happened because he lied to me. Right now we've gotten to an agreement that we'll work through this together, but I'm honestly lost. I don't know where to begin because my mind is telling me that he's lied to me and I'm too insecure to put trust into him again, but I really love him and I want to do it.

There were no dress codes for the presentation but I still dressed in business casual to show some respect to the professor, and the girl sitting next to me said, 'omg you try so hard', she said it out loud in a small conference room. I was so pissed and I said, 'there's nothing wrong with trying hard'. I got an A for this project for 'trying so hard'.
Something I'd like to make clear is that there's no such thing called 'try so hard', you either work hard for it or you don't. What do you have to lose as a damn college student? Those who tell others that they 'try too hard' can go FUCK themselves. ",,"trigger warning, serious",
12438,2019-04-28 23:01:39,"Honestly, I'm so glad that I have finally have a group of friends with whom I fit in with at UCSD. I had a group of friends fall quarter whom I still love, but I genuinely did not really fit in with them. 

I say this because the friends I have now are people who I can relate to. One of them has to support themselves with two jobs because they are in poverty. Another one is a refugee from the middle east and a DACA recipient. I myself am also in a disadvantaged situation: hereditary neurodegenerative eye disease, and my family of five still lives in a 2-bedroom apartment.  

We don't take an Uber to go get boba and hot pot because we don't have 50 dollars to blow for a single night. None of us have the luxury to spend a Saturday night getting drunk and throwing up because we all work on Sundays. 

I am so thankful for these friends I have made. They understand me as I understand them. I don't have to pretend to not like boba anymore because I can't afford it. I don't have to order the least expensive thing at BJ's because holy shit I ain't paying 15 dollars for one fucking meal anymore. I don't have to go hang with friends anymore simply because I don't have money to pay for the booze anymore.

Instead, we find free events and share them with each other. We took advantage of the Sun God $5 lyft to go off campus to downtown. We made our own sandwiches for the day. We buy dining dollars for 2:1 ratio because it is such a bargain.

Truly blessed.

Have you ever met someone with major, obvious personality flaws and wonred how they got there? What kind of trauma or bullying did they go through? Why is their mindset so negative or angry, etc?

I recently stopped my BC pill because I wanted to see what would happen to my body off of hormones (p.s. it was great, i lost weight and my skin is glowing).  However I now need a new form of long term anti-baby method. I've been looking into the Copper IUD but i've heard about possible Copper toxicity and intense monthly PMS :(

IT IS ALL ABOUT THE CLIT. The clit is the button to happiness. FOCUS ON THE CLIT. The clit is amazing. Not that penetration isn‚Äôt either - but it just never gets to the point that most women want to orgasm. 

Oral sex + playing with the clit = orgasm. See what the girl likes!!! For example, I like side to side motion and up and down if my clit hood is pushed up a little. I orgasm in minutes when a guy does what I want. And you girls could too if the guy you‚Äôre in bed with wasn‚Äôt selfish!",,nsfw,

If you respond to someone saying they don‚Äôt like Californians by raving about how awesome California is and how much you love the beach and where you‚Äôre from, you totally missed the point. No one‚Äôs mad you like living here and don‚Äôt want to leave !!!! Nobody would argue that the weather and the beach and having cultural hubs like LA and SF is bad. That why we come here!! 
The problem is with the people who grow up here, have never left, and thus have no perspective about life outside of California. And I get not everybody has the means to travel, that‚Äôs understandable. But I have had too many people who grew up in the Bay or OC and never lived anywhere else spew opinions at me about why the rest of the country sucks and why people in the Midwest or South are bad. It‚Äôs nonsense. And people saying they have no desire to leave EVER kinda just show how little they care about the rest of the country, which is very stereotypical for you all.
Part of what drove me to go out of state for college was to live in a totally new place and be around people from different backgrounds and who have different experiences. So coming here and being met with a lot of Californians who have so many preconceived notions about the rest of the country and no desire to actually learn about them is INCREDIBLY disheartening. I‚Äôve lived in 4 different states in very different regions of the US and this is the first place I‚Äôve experienced anything like this. It‚Äôs part of the reason I have no desire to stay here after I graduate, even though the state itself is so wonderful üòì

We aren't out & about making fun of guy's height, we just have our own preferences and ideal types. At the end of the day, the person we end up having a romantic relationship with might not even be tall (as we ""imagined"") and it won't even matter as long as we love them for who they are. Yes, it's hard to grow, but it's also hard to lose weight. God created us all very differently, we literally come in different shapes and sizes, but that doesn't mean that all tall girls are bxtches and want to be with  a tall guy. Some girls prefer men who are the same height even shorter, there's nothing wrong about it. But societal norms are usually the guys are taller, if not, the same height as women. I dated two guys in the past who were both over 6ft. And recently crushed on a guy who's actually shorter than me, but we ended up being just good friend (not bc of his height) but b/c he's a freshman and I'm a senior & I don't swerve like that, LOL.

And whenever we finally do meet, you make my day every single time.

But I will do as I have done for the past 7 months and demonstrate to you how much you mean to me. You make my world so much better and brighter and beautiful. You are such a wonderful human being and so goddamn beautiful inside and out, it fuckin‚Äô unreal. I don‚Äôt care what you say or what you believe about who you think you are and what you look like. You are so incredibly beautiful. Never let anyone tell you otherwise.

12347,2019-04-26 19:37:02,"With just days to go before my supply of jerky and nuts from home finally runs out, I recently went out on a hunt with my trusty rifle at my side and came across this most majestic goose. Had a bit of a gander and found that she was leading all of her little goslings around in a nearby lake. I suppose that indicated that she was the mother goose. However, I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to raise my rifle to secure sustenance for the next couple of days. It‚Äôs not because of all the goslings surrounding her. Truth of the matter is that, one day, we all have to leave our mothers and brothers and sisters to lead our own lives and worlds. Also, I need grub and ain‚Äôt gonna starve to death when there‚Äôs a source of fresh protein right there in front of me. But rather, it‚Äôs because I am afraid that I‚Äôll miss and all it will quite literally turn into a wild goose chase. 

You see, I‚Äôve never been a very good hunter or marksman. Never had anything to show for these hunts. Always aimed a bit too high or got a bit too close. I know a number of people who are excellent hunters and marksmen, who come back with sacks full of their kills. On the flip side, there are people like the British hunter I befriended, a man as calm and refined as Zaroff yet nowhere near as successful or murderous, as well as another gentleman from the former Raj whom I also befriended, another unsuccessful big game hunter who also hasn‚Äôt been particularly successful. We all give each other hunting tips despite being equally unsuccessful in the field. Don‚Äôt know how useful the tips we give each other are, but by God, the camaraderie we have between us almost makes all the pain from bad hunts worth it, and I thank the Lord everyday I have them in my life. I pray to our heavenly Father that one day, they will all get their big break and finally have something to show for their efforts.

So here I am, sitting in the cold dampness of my hunting lodge. Haven‚Äôt a fire going, haven‚Äôt found a need to get a fire going. No goose, no need for fire. But man, I am running out of food. If I don‚Äôt go out there again and at least try to get that goose before she and her goslings go away, then my goose will really be cooked (haha, the irony). Then I‚Äôll be left wondering if my situation could have ended up different and better, if starvation and failure was the only option, if I would have been successful. Well, I suppose I ought to quit acting like a silly goose myself. No more anxiety. No more delays. It‚Äôs time to shoot my shot. ",,randommisunderstandingstorytimefromanuncreativestoryteller,

I had a really bad and awkward experience with one of the guys at 3 am. It was really late and I went over to his single. We never discussed his size or anything which was a mistake I realize now. When he whipped his small noodle out I was really disappointed it was so small. I tried to ride his dick, and I felt nothing at all. It was the most boring and uneventful sex I had ever had. I understand that a lot of asian guys are really smart and make a lot of money, but most of them unfortunately have a small penis which I cannot accept.

We would frequent the gym at similar times, and eventually started working out together. Big dude, large muscles, manly...your typical jock. Unsurprisingly, he was full of stories about all his hot-chick hookups (due to his inevitably attractive looks, you see). Most stories involved him going somewhere and having girls beg to be with him, multiple at a time, a real panty dropper you see. Well, one day, while finishing up a workout, he mentioned this party (gettogether) happening at his place later that night, suggesting I should go as it was ""bound to be full of ass"". I, being a grad student with nothing better to do on a Friday night, decided to go.  And yes, I must admit the place was full of people, men and women, but mostly chicks; the slutty-looking, cock-thristy kind, as he described them. Anyway, after many drinks, I ended up in what appeared to be a sex room; sparse groups of people performing some sort of sexual act. He was there, with a random chick. Honestly, it didn't feel uncomfortable (having gone through the ""wild"" stages of sexual exploration during undergrad, it seemed normal; or at least tolerable). What sorta was strange was being pulled aside by him to ""play"" with the chick accompanying him, which then turned into me fucking her. After some time, this jocky, manly, iron-pumping stallion of a panty dropper mentioned that ""since I was having so much fun pleasuring this girl, I should go ahead and pound him some"". Weird request, I must admit. But eh, I pounded his tight little asshole. It is rather interesting how impressions and stereotypical expectations work at times. I have not seen him at the gym since, although the chick from that night comes by my office during the evenings at least once a week. ",,nsfw,

12222,2019-04-26 12:08:34,"Very unpopular opinion, especially among this group, but does anyone else feel like college is a borderline scam?

I graduated and am currently in the process of getting a job in EE. I‚Äôm not saying not going to college is the better option. Of course I wouldn‚Äôt be getting these interviews without my degree. Of course college opens up a lot of opportunities. 

But I don‚Äôt think college really made that much of a difference. Everything that I learned for this career could‚Äôve been learned in a few months. Definitely under a year, let alone 4+. 

There‚Äôs so much fluff in college. 2 years of essentially learning garbage that you went over in high school. Things that you‚Äôll never use or care about. And we fucking pay for it! Five thousand fucking dollars per quarter to go through this useless bullshit

And then upper division. Professors don‚Äôt care about the students. 90% of them anyway. They‚Äôre here for research, not to teach. Students end up learning mostly from textbooks or on their own. Then what the fuck is the point of taking a class of I‚Äôm Learning most of the content on my own?

I understand this will vary depending on the major. But it applies to me and many of my peers. 

I‚Äôve worked at internships before, alongside people making a very good amount of money. Many of them are in the six figure range that doesn‚Äôt start with a 1. None of them get as bombarded with work as my peers do. Academia can get extremely hard and stressful and I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs reasonable. It doesn‚Äôt reflect a real work environment. 

Again, I understand I‚Äôm basing this off my experience and that it will vary. But I would honestly be surprised if a large amount of work environments reflect the stress that students go through. 

Overall, college is an extremely inefficient way of preparing people for a career. There are absolutely better ways to do it. ",[redacted],rant,

12202,2019-04-26 04:59:56,"to #11721, after seeing your three posts and reading all the harsh comments from other people, I have to say that I can relate with you as a fellow Christian. I'm not a guy, but I also get slightly turned on when I see some attractive guys (face-wise or body-wise). Since I'm a girl, Idk if I would be labeled as a ""creep"" like you were. Yes, there is something immoral about such reactions, but that doesn't define us as creeps. I'd say that someone is a creep if they end up crossing boundaries, such as taking photos, stalking, verbally/physically harassing the person, etc. Hormones can be hard to control, especially in college.
In response to your predicament though, I'd say that you have to decide whether your spiritual life or physical life is more important. Of course, nothing seems to be going wrong for your friends who have sex, but that's only based off of your judgement. God is there to judge, so you only need to focus on yourself. What happens to other people isn't going to necessarily be the same for you. You might end up feeling extremely guilty if you have sex before marriage. You'll further distance yourself away from God as well. I'm a Christian, but I've had multiple sexual partners and I can't tell you how guilty I feel. I'm worried about how it affects my relationship with God. But then again, I also believe that He already knew I would have these sins. Under religious standards, sex is meant to be a gift that you enjoy with your special person. I personally support your sexual abstinence because it'll bring you greater rewards. If you do give in to that temptation, it'll be hard to control it afterwards. Just a fair warning. and of course, with any sin, you should try to repent for it. If you don't, you're kinda just disregarding His authority. Whatever happens, God has love for everyone, so don't feel burdened.
And to the non-religious people, I know you're extremely skeptical of Christianity, but Christianity, and any other religion, does provide meaning, guidance, and hope to people's lives. Religion isn't a scapegoat for one's shortcomings and it isn't an escape from reality. Some of us just care a lot about our spiritual lives and it's hard to decide whether we care about the spiritual or physical side of things. It isn't an easy task to disregard religion, so it makes sense why OP is having a hard time over this. Religion is just something we value and trust in a lot. Having a lot of trust in something usually leads to obedience. I know it sounds hypocritical of me to say that, but I'm still a growing Christian (fairly new to be honest) and I'm learning how to trust in God more so that I can be obedient. Practicing obedience also means that you have the patience for God's rewards. And these rewards may not necessarily manifest physically. I know that y'all don't agree, and that's totally fine. It's hard for Christians to fully agree with the Bible too. 
ANYWAYS, I don't want this to turn into a religious debate or whatever, I just couldn't silently read some of the comments on the original post. Like hey, practicing sexual abstinence doesn't mean you're ugly or that you lack social skills, it just means you got a lot of willpower for the Lord lol. It's not that hard to find a hookup nowadays. Also, I think that a lot of the girls on campus are pretty in some way, so yea that Triton eye comment was pretty mean.",,,

With your insightful comments on everything from Joey tribbiani's supposed orientation to making fun of people that talk about problems being sexually active and asking them to contact a locksmith, I must say that you have definitely raised creep flags as well as offended people over here. It is indeed ironical that you have called Asians cancer, while you are an Asian yourself, or is it? As not a upstanding member of the community, but a normal person I'd suggest you refrain from commentary that denigrates yourself as you so finely have all this while. 

Tldr: Bro, please come up with an awful comeback to this like a ""you momma so fat"" joke so these people know what I'm talking about ",,,

I didn't know what to say but it made me uncomfortable as he went on to describe and praise areas of my body I'm usually uncomfortable with people commenting on. I guess it's the same as people saying ""you have great tits"" or something but it was just super weird.

Because now I understand I don't actually want to die. Processing these feelings into things that are less defeating and all-encompassing makes my emotions more tangible. For the better, I stop spiraling into a depressive hole of wanting to die as my only solution. 

""I don't want to experience stress"", ""I wish I didn't read that"", ""I wish I understood this problem"", I can process properly. I can live, and live with these emotions. They're still sad emotions, but I can cry to myself saying these phrases instead of ""I want to die"" over and over.

We then get the Tony/Nebula sequence (paper football, etc). Tony records his message to Pepper. When he falls asleep, Nebula takes him to the front of the ship and sits him in the pilots seat. He wakes up and sees something glowing outside the window. Captain Marvel helps them return to Earth. Pepper, Rocket, Steve and Rhodey all come out to greet him. Tony is very shaken, particularly about losing Peter.

Movie starts with the Avengers trying to find Thanos. Steve wasn‚Äôt to know where Thanos is and asks Tony, but Tony says he doesn‚Äôt know, They argue. Nebula knows of Thanos‚Äô garden he said he would once go to when he completed his goal. They found him because of the energy he released using the gauntlet. Thanos is alone, and tells them he used the gauntlet to destroy the gems. He is weak and Thor, angry, decapitates him.

Title Card and five years later.

Natasha is now basically in charge of what's left of the Avengers is talking to them via holograms. Basically the world is in ruins and they're trying to salvage it. Carol is there via hologram with a new haircut and uniform and tells them that she's covering thousands of planets and won't be able to come back to Earth for a ""long time"".

Steve and Nat talk about how the Avengers are family. Inside a storage shed is Luis‚Äôs van. A rat is crawling over the Quantum controls and activated the switch which brings Scott out. He‚Äôs now locked inside the cage but starts waving at the security cameras. A guard lets him out and he is walking the streets confused as to why everything is so overgrown and run down. He finds a memorial which lists the names of the ‚Äòmissing‚Äô on large stones. He starts reading them panicking that Cassie might be listed on them. But she isn‚Äôt. He sees her at home, as an older version of herself. Scott drives to the Avengers facility and Nat and Steve let him in and he tells them about the Quantum realm and how they might be able to build a time machine to go back to the past before everything happened. They visit Tony, but he doesn‚Äôt want to help. He‚Äôs happy with the way that his life is, with Pepper and his daughter Morgan. They leave and to visit Bruce who is now Professor Hulk.

The plan becomes to start looking for the gems in the past. Initially Banner builds quantum time machine and sends Scott back to test but it is faulty, Tony refuses to help at this point, however, he returns Caps shield and they make up. He tweaks Banners Quantum Machine, The catch is that they need quantum particles for it to work.

Natasha goes to Japan to get Clint. He is mourning his family and is not certain of the plan. Rocket and Hulk go to get Thor who is drinking and playing video games with Korg and Meik. (Funny joke involving an online video game troll)

Finally the team then all suit up and discuss their plans to get the stones. They make it clear that they can not mess up because there is only enough Quantum particles for one trip for each of them.



Tony, Scott, Steve and Bruce go to the Battle of New York. Hulk meets the Ancient One at Dr Stranger's future home. Ancient One refuses to give the Time Stone to Bruce but relents when Bruce tells her that Dr Strange will give the stone to Thanos.

Cap, Iron Man and Scott tries to retrieve the Tessaract after Loki surrenders. SHIELD/Hydra agents Crossbones and that bald guy with glasses in Winter Soldier retrieve the brief case containing the Tessaract. Past Hulk funnily has to walk down lots of flights of stairs as he can't go on lift due to maximum capacity. Cap meets with Crossbones with the briefcase in elevator along with other Hydra agents. He convinces them to give him the briefcase containing the staff when he utters two words: Hail Hydra. Cap gets the briefcase. Tony in disguise as a SWAT soldier tells Scott to disable his past self's chest reactor to give him a minor seizure while his past self meets up with Alexander Pierce who demands the Mind Stone and Loki. Present Tony retrieves the briefcase but past Hulk accidentally knocks out Tony and Loki uses the confusion to teleport out with the Tessaract. Present Cap accidentally meets with his 2012 self, and 2012 self thinks he's Loki in disguise. They fought and 2012 has present self in chokehold when he tells his past self that Bucky is alive. He then taps his past self with staff to knock him out.

In Asgard, fat Thor and Rocket plans to retrieve the Aether out of Jane Foster's body. Thor's mother meets his 'son' and know he's from the future. Rocket retrieves the aether out of Jane by prodding her off screen and gets chased by guards. Before Thor leaves, he retrieves Mjolnir!

On Morag, War Machine and Nebula stays on Morag while Clint and Nat goes to Voromir via a ship that Rocket miniatures for Clint. Unknown to Nebula, her past self's nervous system and databanks are connected to each other and Thanos finds out where the stones are and how he meets his fate.

Cap and Tony transport back to 1970 at the SHIELD training site seen in Winter Soldier and goes underground to retrieve that era's Tessaract. Tony retrieves the Tesseract while meeting his dad. He calls himself Howard Potts. Cap makes a prank call to young Hank Pym and sneaks into his office to steal 4 vials of Pym Particles. Cap also sees Peggy. Cap and Tony teleport back to present.

WM and Nebula knocks out Quill during his dance in intro of GOTG. They got the stone and WM and Nebula was meant to teleport together but WM only succeeded. Present Nebula and past Nebula meets and fights and past Nebula takes her place to go back to present.

On Voromir, Clint and May meets the Red Skull as seen in Infinity War and is told how to retrieve the stone. Clint and Nat fought each other. Clint jumped off cliff but Nat catches him and held on by grappling rope. She falls off and dies like Gamora. Clint now has the Stone.

All members went back to present and everyone is devastated by Nat's death. Tony and Bruce constructs the Infinity Gauntlet and Thor wants to wield it but Hulk goes instead as he's the strongest one and the stones emit gamma radiation according to him. He wields it and snaps his fingers restoring all life lost. Clint's wife calls him on mobile. Hulk suffers extreme pain in his right arm due to IG. Past Nebula activates the Quantum teleporter and summons Thanos' warship and blasts the Avengers HQ to ruins with missiles.

Hulk lifting up rubble similar to Secret Wars cover where he lifts up a whole mountain except this is less in film lol.

Clint finds the gauntlet and is being chased by Outriders creatures in last film. He kills them and is met by past Nebula. Gamora and present Nebula meets up and Nebula kills her past self.

Cap, Tony and Thor teams up against Thanos. Thor is losing against Thanos even though he has Stormbreaker and Mjolnir. Thanos is about to kill Thor with SB when:

Cap lifts up Mjolnir and beats Thanos with hammer and shield.

Thanos uses his double blade weapon to break Cap's shield in half.

Thanos summons his whole army including the Black Order and some new creatures. Cap is all by himself against a whole army.

He hears Sam's voice and he turns around and see EVERYONE who has vanished PLUS huge armies of Wakandans, sorcerers and Asgardians (no signs of Warrior Three). Wong, Valkyrie, Wasp and Pepper Potts as Rescue turns up as well. Ant Man becomes Giant Man.

Clint plays American Football with IG and passes it to Black Panther then Spidey. Quill meets past Gamora and gets hit in the balls, not believing he is the one she loves lol. Scarlet Witch overpowers Thanos but Thanos orders missiles to hit everyone including his forces. Captain Marvel shows up to destroy Thanos' flagship and gets the IG and dashes towards the goal. There is a bit where Hope and Scott goes to the van with the Quantum teleporter in the middle of battlefield. Was lost in the moment so forgot why they doing that, sorry.

All female Marvel characters fight Thanos. Spidey's armoured suit goes autokill mode with the extra arms.

Thanos tries to take the gauntlet off Marvel by headbutting her but didn't phase her.

Thanos retrieves the gauntlet away from Stark and he snaps his fingers. Nothing happened. The stones went to Stark and before he snaps his fingers, he says 'I'm Iron Man'.

White flash of light.

All of Thanos' forces turn to dust including Thanos himself.

Tony dies from using the gauntlet. Everyone mourns.

The battle is won but at a cost.

Holographic Tony gives a message to everyone present including his daughter.

A wreath with Tony's chest reactor is laid to rest at the lake near Tony's hut.

Everyone is present including GOTG, Peter, Maria, Ross, Nick and Hank and Janet.

Thor, still fat designates Valkyrie as Queen of New Asgard in Tonnsberg. Thor is now travelling with GOTG to find Gamora and maybe more Asgardians. Quill and Thor are about to fight for leadership lol.

Scott, Cassie and Hope are together again. Wakanda is back with his King.

Cap goes on a mission to put back the stones and Mjolnir to their proper places. Hulk says to Sam and Buck that he should be back in 5 secs. He didn't. Sam sees a old man at a bench and it's Old Man Steve (who looks like Clint Eastwood now but less wrinkles and bit younger than he is lol). Steve has wedding ring and passes his shield to Sam. Sam is honoured.

Ending shows young Cap dancing with Peggy at their house. That's it.

Credits music is set to 1930s music then shows all cast members. The main cast is shown with their signatures on it.

There is NO post credit scenes which is a first for a MCU.

Stan Lee cameo is set in 1970s where he is shown in his 70s younger self driving a car with a woman, driving past a army base where Cap and Tony retrieves the Tesseract there.

I also feel awful that my race oppresses them. The problem is...well I'm the problem. As a white male, I'm just adding more white-ness to the subfield that doesn't need it.

It's so funny when guys have to justify their fkboi-ness by passing it off as iMmAtUrItY. just say that you never learned how to be a decent human being, and that your pathetically horny ass would much rather dick around with feelings that aren't yours to make yourself feel better abt how emotionally stunted you are, and GO.

""They're just immature and don't know what they want?"" Hell, a LOT of ppl don't know what they want in life, or from others, but they don't make it their mission statement to toy around with the ppl in their lives, or to use them.

""They could use meaningful friends"" no SHIT, dumbass, we all do. the already flimsy explanation of why fkbois are the way they are by blaming it on how s h i t t y their support system is bollocks. FUCK that noise, it's not our responsiblity to H E A L them or HELP THEM SEE THE LIGHT, the argument that these ppl don't have good friends is stupid as shit. Having a large, impersonal group of friends does not make you a piece of shit LMAOOOOO. trying to find excuses for your destructive behavior and lack of self-awareness DOES.

An actual hot take: guys who have to justify that they're Not Fuckbois.... ARE fuckbois.

Another one: softbois are Also fuckbois, y'all the same species, don't try to distinguish yourselves

Last one: hey *, u kno who u r-- if you're reading this, I am so sorry that you have to wallow in your own self-pity to make yourself feel better abt how you hurt the current person you're seeing. Stop acting like your guilt overpowers your girl's hurt after the bullshit you pulled on her. She doesn't have to comfort YOU on how you hurt HER during the time that YOU have to apologize. Either cuff her and give her what you told her you would, or I will. Step up, dude, you're not fucking special. 

and for the last guy **, you never learned, did you? Your current girlfriend doesn't know what you've been doing behind her back. And you know that, and I hope that eats you from the inside out. I hope it festers so much that all you can spit out is bile and poison and you'll be choking on your own mistakes so hard that no one will be able to hear your pathetic excuses. You had costume jewelry but now that you have sterling silver in your hands you still long for something that's cheap and easy. I feel so sorry for you. You never deserved this much.

Honestly, I don't know if I have a right to be upset, because it's natural for people joke around a lot. It's just that I don't feel like we're that close, and I don't insult them back. It's also confusing because they occasionally do nice things for me (such as share notes or get food together), but then for the next few days they make a big deal about how nice they are.
They've said things like ""are you so dumb that you have to take notes about XXX topic?"", ""Shut up and buy me food"", and ""Why'd you sit in my seat, you ruin everything."" In class, they'll use my desk as personal storage for their items, talk frequently, poke me/grab my hand while I'm writing, write on my notebook, and physically take away my notebook. It's pretty distracting because I'm already struggling in that class, and I just want to get a decent grade. I don't do any of these things back to them, and I've told them several times variations of ""please don't touch my stuff"" or ""why can't you use your own desk?"" I've tried to keep it light, but I honestly can't take it anymore. 
Sorry if I'm being oversensitive, I just needed to get that out there. If anyone has any advice, it would be appreciated :) I know I should probably get more confidence and just straight up tell them that I don't like how they're treating me. Unfortunately, I can't just ignore them because we'll be in class for the rest of the quarter and we share a couple outside commitments (orgs, etc) that I value too much to quit. ",,sad,

11954,2019-04-24 16:19:25,"Hi guys! I wrote #11713 a short while back about feeling ready to break up with my boyfriend because he's not the best friend I want in a partner.

Teagan commented that it has to do with my insecurities and that I feel like I can't be 100% myself with him and breaking up with him won't solve the issue if I get into a relationship again. And you know what? You're right. I'm a big fat goofball with my friends because I don't care how they see me--they're my friends and we unconditionally love each other. But with him, he is absolutely everything I could ask for, and the stakes feel higher, which is why it has been harder for me to completely wind down and be comfortable being the goofy, fun, dumbass that I am.  We are steadily getting better over time, and I was just having a moment of weakness and impatience with the fact that we aren't there yet. I already know it's up to me to work on me, but he holds my hand through it all and I couldn't bear not having him in my life. I love him. I'm in love with him.

Thank you guys for being an outlet for me and for telling me the things I needed to hear, especially as people outside of my life. <3",,love,

+/- she‚Äôs told me multiple times how she wants to get to know me better, and how she wants me to get to know her better
+ we‚Äôve talked about relationships in general and how we want something serious in our relationship

+(?) she told me she deleted Tinder (not for me I don‚Äôt think)
+/- she told me I should go on Tinder cause I‚Äôm a funny and good looking dude

+(?) I can consistently make her genuinely laugh
+/- I‚Äôm not the one starting all conversations, nor are they one-sided

11923,2019-04-23 22:20:39,"Honestly, if you are still letting those negative ass thoughts run your mind into a depressive black hole thinking you can shelter those thoughts, it will be hard to get out of it. However that is why when your depressed ass is talking to itself, you gotta turn that shit upside down and literally tell yourself you believe in yourself multiple times even if it gets repetitive. If you keep on believing in yourself, at least in my experience, you will gain motivation again to do the work your depressed ass had no motivation to do before and procrastinated on. So instead of thinking about that crush, or friend that never messaged you back, or takes forever to respond and doesn't seem to give you back the attention you give them and you're sad about that, drop that shit. Throw your mind into a new path in believing yourself first. You have nothing to prove to others, you just need to prove to yourself first with self confidence in getting shit done.
Sincerely, op from #11440, the crushes ain't shit op, yes they still ain't shit either. Self motivate yourself with positive thoughts and tell your depressed ass you can do it. I know you can.

Thankfully I'm done with that now but I literally have lab tomorrow where we're getting our next assignment which is due Monday. It apparently used to be easy but now we use a program called Snap made by people at UC Berkley. The program glitches a lot and has to be restarted all the time.

""Someones got a bad case of triton eye""
Oof. Maybe, but I do think that it's overplayed and that there are genuinely some very attractive girls here.

‚ÄúReligious reasons‚Äù
""It likely means they're ugly and lack the social skills needed to pursue in this case women. Religion in this context is nothing more than a scapegoat for OP's own shortcomings""

Dang. I thought this place was supposed to be nice. This comment is low-key hurtful but I'll address it nonetheless.

I have platonic relationships with both sexes, and have had flirtatious relationships with girls in the past, so no, I don't lack the social skills to talk to women. I'm also not particularly ugly going by what others have said. How exactly is religion a scapegoat for my shortcomings? What exactly are my shortcomings in this case? No, my being abstinent is not because I am ugly or because I cannot talk to females (which I don't think is an actual issue that people have because females are just‚Ä¶people.) Rude and baseless comment though. 

""I dunno OP, you tell us. Why do you choose to stay abstinent? Is it worth it? You know, give us some more deets.""

Very valid question. I believe sex within marriage is the only place where it is acceptable as it is a mirror of Christ being the groom to the bride who is the church. Practically, the reason is that it avoids the pitfalls of hookup culture. I've been told all my life that I should be abstinent because of the aforementioned reasons, but in college, I'm now surrounded by people who constantly have extramarital sex and, well, nothing seems to be going wrong for them. So the predicament I'm in is that I'm questioning why exactly I'm doing this if everyone else isn't and they are fine. That's basically what I'm internally struggling with. I don't know if it's worth it or not. 

""Don't mean to offend, I was also raised Christian. But maybe you should stop believing that god cares about when or who you fuck.""

No offense taken, this is a relatively mild comment. This just gets down to your presuppositions of life and what is moral so I can't really remediate this here. Just different views. I believe He does, you believe he doesn't.

11774,2019-04-22 21:32:03,"This is in response to confession #11625 where OP wanted Asian Americans to ""acknowledge our privilege."" I understand where you're coming from. I understand that the Asian community has a long ways to go to work on our anti-blackness (this for real is an issue, especially among older generations, so please @ my fellow asian americans help your parents, grandparents, etc. to understand!!). And I get that some people may perceive that systematic racism does not affect us as much as others, which, in some cases, is true.
But, here's the thing:
""Asian"" is such a diverse term. When you say Asian, do you mean Laotian, Indian, Viet, Filipino, Chinese, etc.? Do you understand the difference in socioeconomic standing between south, southeast, east, and west asians? Why would you lump all of us into one group? Do you know what it's like to have your fellow POC not see you as a POC but for white people to still hold you beneath them because of some stupid model minority myth?
Your perception of the Asian American community is only a fraction of our reality. Many of us have immigrant parents, who fled war or poverty, to come here (my dad left vietnam on a boat by himself when he was only 15). A lot of us have parents who can't speak english, parents who need you to translate things for them when you go out to the market, parents who don't know anything about college, so you have to figure it all out on your own, parents who don't get hired because their english is ""bad"". A lot of southeast asian americans work low income jobs: nail salon techs, supermarket employees, etc. It's demanding, tough work, and people don't respect them, just look at how often people mock nail techs.
What you see about Asian Americans is only what the media portrays, what is barely skimmed over in American history books.
You say you aren't going to deny that Asian Americans have faced discrimination historically, but you only mention dog-eating jokes and the fetish around Asian women, so I hope you also recognize that the historical discrimination of Asians goes beyond that. Chinese Americans were laborers who worked on the railroads in America in terrible conditions. Japanese American citizens were forced into internment camps during WWII bc white people thought they were ""spies"". Vietnamese Americans lived with 3 or more families in a home after fleeing the war. And even today, Asian Americans face discrimination that goes beyond some dog jokes: Southeast Asian gang members from the 70s/80s face deportation threats today: Trump is pushing for the deportation of Vietnamese Americans ""with a criminal record"" who came here before 1995, even if the crime they committed happened when they were teenage gang members in the 70s/80s, and so, so much more.
But this isn't the oppression olympics. We shouldn't fight over who had it worse, but instead, recognize that each POC group has faced and continues to face their own struggle here in America. If we want justice, we have to stick and fight together.
We have to realize the faults we've had to each other and work to improve our communities instead of tearing each other down. I can't speak for other POC groups, but as Asian Americans, this means we need to realize that our community is historically anti-black, don't fucking use the n-word because it's ""cool"", educate yourself and your family and friends, make our community better--not bitter.
And to the OP of the mentioned post, I hope this was somewhat informational, and I hope you can understand how your generalizations of the Asian American community has hurt a lot of people.",,serious,

My point is I think it would help me to at least learn how my body works-regardless of my sexual orientation and at least being able to ""bust a nut"" might be helpful.

comment,2019-04-22 11:43:24,"To the OP of 11625. Honestly fuck you. Your post on how Asian Americans only feel discrimination in the form of things like jokes PROVES you have no grasp on history at all and is just dumb in fucking general as you essentially preach fucking more tolerance for African Americans and Latinix people then write a horribly intolerant post. I'm a member of Nikkei Student Union, the Japanese American club on campus, and when I was told many people didn't really know about Japanese internment I didn't believe them but obviously it's true. So here's a little education for you:
Japanese internment camps was a knee jerk reaction of fear and racism. After Pearl Harbor was bombed by the Japanese, many Americans started to have this logic, if you're Japanese you must be a spy. So President Franklin D. Roosevelt himself signed executive order 9066. Where 120,000 Japanese people were sent to concentration camps in the US for two and a half years corcing them to leave their lives and belongings behind. Keep in mind roughly 80,000 of these people were CITIZENS OF THE UNITED STATES and the US betrayed them and said, ""No you guys are second class citizens"". On top of that martial law was enacted in Hawaii to specifically target Japanese who lived there. The FBI went door to door questioning people, and my great grandmother had TO BURN her only picture of her nephew because he was dressed in Japanese military garb because they would think she was a spy. Remember around ww2 pictures weren't that easy of a commodity to come by too.
Anyways even after internment ended things didn't get magically better because when japanese came back all their old belongings were gone and they literally had to start life over. Then you know what they got in return for the civil rights atrocity? Fucking $20,000. Because that somehow makes up for two years of being wrongly imprisoned and losing everyhton you have. Then it seems people like you seem to forget/ignore this horrible atrocity. Which shows another thing about Asian discrimination you completely ignore. We are fucking forgotten. When you hear someone make a racist joke about African Americans, I'm sure you're horrified, but when you hear one about Asian people, I will bet money you laugh your head off.
There is so much you don't understand and this long ass post doesn't even begin to fully cover it. So before you go and try to tear a whole other race down fucking think about what you're about to say. Rant over jackass.",,"serious, history lesson",
11786,2019-04-22 11:39:19,"There's been a lot of bisexual questioning posts, and I just wanna say, it doesn't always have to come down to if you want to have sex with them. I can fall in love both boys and girls, but I've found that I don't exactly feel sexually attracted to guys. And that's okay. That doesn't change the fact that I'm in love with a boy and have the sweetest relationship right now, because we don't put an emphasis on sex. If sex is a really big part of what you want, then it requires more talking, but romantic feelings can go a long way.

Sexuality is complicated, and hard to define even with all the labels we have. Romance and sex can be different. Don't miss out on the chance to hold their hand, make out with them before yall sleep, and wake up to someone who makes your heart flutter, just because society has placed such a big importance on sex. Of course, talk about it with them but it doesn't have to be the deciding factor. Love is love :)",,,

There's just something about her that turns me on so much, it's not just her looks, it's everything about her, even the way she makes eye contact with me is both intimidating but also inexplicably turns me on. The fact that she mentioned that she's a dom in one of our conversations also doesn't help either. I know for a fact that she doesn't do this on purpose, and I also don't intend to act on these feelings ever. I just want to find a way to stop feeling overwhelmingly aroused every time I talk to her. It's genuinely distracting and makes me act like a bumbling fool when she's with me. I still want to talk to her just because our conversations are always interesting, but how do I keep myself from feeling this? I genuinely want to keep talking to her, not because of my attraction, but because our conversations are truly enjoyable without the whole attraction thing. It's just something about the way she carries herself, that makes me both scared and attracted to her. It's so weird.

Probably the worst is that when they go shop for groceries, because when they come back, the fridge and freezer is stacked with their food, and leave my roommate and I half a shelf on the door, and less than half of the top rack in the fridge. The freezer is always stuffed to max capacity too. So when my roommate and I go grocery shopping, we have to organize with what little space we were given, if any.

I'm just so tired of coming back and seeing such a mess, one time I cleaned the whole downstairs area, and not even a day later, it's back to looking like a tornado hit the apartment. We've talked to the other girls about apartment rules, and about cleanliness, but it seems like it just never sticks and it feels hopeless and trapping.",,long,

I've lost my friends through chance (like schedules conflicting til we eventually drift apart :< ), through conflict, through graduations/drop outs, and even through a few times my depressed ass ghosted them because I felt like a burden.

When it comes to new friendships, I try my best to invest in them but it often gets emotionally draining for me, now :( . Luckily, I do still have a small handful of friends that have stayed beside me (""something, something... a few close friends are better than more superficial ones""). And through them, I know what it feels like to have real friendships: people who I don't feel insecure about reaching out to and people who make my smile last for days. I LOVE the people who I get to hang out with today, they're so damn amazing!

But regardless, seeing/remembering the friends I've lost hurts me. I miss these friendships and figuratively wanna write a ""Thank you"" note to each and every one of them (even the ones that ended in conflict).

of the rear window mirror; in flight as pigeons 
nakedly racing towards a sky in furor,
drunk at the river of her ceaseless ambitions,

And let her find that stars drown in light,
which paints darkened city streets with gold,
with pathways that glitter, but leave with night
and reveal with sight, that she is a bird
who longs for marigold in the grasp & hold
that is her only birthright

Let she who can

so that the wind may carry them, stripped to bone
to deaden her whisper and finally become stone

11609,2019-04-20 01:55:04,"MASS SHOOTING - WHAT TO DO

I'm an international student and I want to put this out there because as much as most Americans know what to do in these situations given recent events, many internationals don't because we haven't been exposed to this or taught how to do this. I also don't wanna assume all americans know what to do in one of these events, so this is just a general post to anyone who wants to feel more informed. I've gotten this info from research i've done myself, and most of my sources agree on the same things.

1. AVOID - if you hear something that sounds like gunshots, don't hesitate or wait around for other people to act. Take action and protect yourself - if there is no risk in the way, GET OUT OF THE ZONE AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. Notify others, or take others with you. Always know your exits, wherever you are. LEAVE EVERYTHING. You may want to text your family saying you're ok, but reality is you're not gonna be ok until you're off the shooter's range. Once you're outside and safe, call people - police, 911, family members, friends, etc. Prevent people from entering the area. 

2. DENY - If you can't exit the area, you must find a place you're gonna take shelter and deny the shooter. Eg. if shooter is in the hallway and you're inside a classroom, EVERYONE must act quickly and block the door with as many things as possible- chairs, tables, you can even get creative and use stuff like belts, books, or everyone's backpacks. Do so and then find shelter inside the classroom, stay away from the door as the shooter might start shooting through the door. Turn off all lights, stay away from doors and windows to avoid being seen. Your job here is to make it difficult for the shooter to catch targets. Remain quiet, put your phones in silent mode. You might be hiding but be prepared to fight should the shooter enter the room. 

3. DEFEND - If you are unable to exit or prevent the shooter entry to where you are, this is your last resort. Think of this: he's one shooter with a gun, but you are probably a lecture hall of 100+ students. Be committed to fight back. If one person fights back, the shooter will probably take him down. If 20 people fight back, say by throwing stuff, he stands less of a chance. You can throw furniture, books, tables, laptops, maybe you create a distraction plan while waiting for him to come. Your goal is to disarm and take down the shooter. If you manage to disarm him, DON'T KEEP HOLDING THE GUN. Throw it across the room if you can. Police will come in looking for the person with the gun, you don't wanna be arrested when you in fact disarmed the shooter. The more the people who fight back, the greater the change of survival. Of course 300 people throwing books at one guy could get messy, but everyone can do something, plan something out if you have the time. The shooter is not expecting anyone to fight back, let alone a whole class of students. Use this to your advantage and catch him off guard. Also, be loud and aggressive. Might sound stupid, but it could intimidate the shooter if a class of 100+ people come at him all at once. 

Feel free to add anything else, this is obviously not the only way to survive, and none of these will ensure 100% survival from a shooting, but it increases your chances. Remember, in any emergency situation, the faster you act the higher the chance of surviving you have. Don't hesitate. This could happen at any moment, and I feel everyone should be aware and know what to expect and what to do. If possible don't leave this in the confessions page, share this info around, if something ever happens we might be able to save a lot more lives. ",,"trigger warning, urgent, serious",

Hi My name is Amy but that's not my real name, I'm only 14 years old,I'm not from Cebu but I'm from Mindanao,In the city of Iligan .

So I wanted to share my life story to you, so actually today, I'm starting to think that I'm depressed why? Because I cry 3 times to 5 times every week, I sometimes plan to commit suicide but I just can't do it, and I also skip breakfast, lunch and sometimes even dinner, yes I have friends, they asked me if I had ate breakfast or lunch I just simply give them my fake smile and tell them that I already ate, I don't know why I'm lying to them but I just did, actually I'm a rebelious child I speak back to my parents, I don't listen to them and sometimes I even wished they were dead by now but....I just said those because I'm angry at them.

At school I'm popular for being the school dancer and I was also known as the Rebelious Teenager, I own that tittle because, I yelled at my teacher and even course her I was almost suspended but the principle gave me another shot.

People see me as a Confident,Reliable and Fearless person,....everytime",,confused,

In comparison to my roommate I am skinnier (she‚Äôs extremely insecure about herself being overweight), taller, in a happy relationship, have a higher GPA, and I guess prettier by societal standards. Everything besides height I work towards. I wake up at 6AM to work out and spend most of my time studying. She on the other hand sleeps until 1pm and plays video games all the time.

Maybe having time for therapy after college will be a solution but for now, I can't help feeling like I just finished riding a roller coaster after waiting in a long line only to see everyone else around me, happy, with friends, in relationships, while I'm left sad and depressed.

11539,2019-04-18 22:12:06,"Read a lot about ""shoot your shot"" on this group. 

So she and I have taken several classes together (and may very probably be taking more in future), plus we have worked and are also currently working together in larger groups on academic and/or outside-the-class projects for over a year now. We've also been chatting and texting each other a lot about a variety of academic and non-academic things. 

Here's my confusions with the ""shooting your shot"":

I don't know how she'll react if I ""shoot my shot"", especially considering that we've been working together for a while and I don't wanna jeopardize my work. Even if I ""confess feelings"" for her, I don't know what to do next: a relationship, keep things as it is, or something else .. ? I am relatively flexible with where she wants to take things, but I also think that both of us are extremely busy people and may not have the time to take things forward either. I guess, I just want to let her know that she's perfect, while being almost completely okay with keeping things almost the same as right now. I won't be able to see her (only texting at the most) during the summer. Idk how to flirt or anything and don't even intend to do it that much; haven't even asked out anyone before. Would still like to be atleast a great friend, though. To make matters even more complicated, she's an Indian American but I am an Indian (*cough* social and cultural constraints on both sides actually)

Hard to totally ignore as the feeling fluctuates. Also been trying hard to look for social cues from her, but it seems pretty mixed-up imo. Unable to share this with anyone either. Been thinking for several months to make this post and been thinking for even more time to talk to her about this. Could probably just still keep everything bottled-up inside me (as I have for almost a year now) and just be thankful that amazing people like her are a part of my life in the first place, but Idk if thats the best option to choose either. Would love some advice and constructive criticism on my thoughts.

KOTX can seem a bit intimidating at first with a lot of people in the club who can be very flamboyant, and have loud personalities at times (not that it‚Äôs a bad thing, just something that can seem intimidating at first to an outsider or an introvert haha). The thing with KOTX, is that everyone in it is very good friends with one another and hang out with one another even outside of the club. I think it‚Äôs natural to walk in and feel a little out of place at first, but everyone in KOTX is very kind and welcoming. If you just go to a GBM and don‚Äôt put an effort to socialize and meet everyone, then that‚Äôs on you.

The comments I've read on that post were a bit concerning to me and I would like to address them. I'd do it under my account but no need to draw negative attention to myself.

1) I think we can all agree that she should have disclosed her status to me. If you disagree then go take a hike.

2) To Page Groeling: I am very much aware that herpes does not place my life in danger. However it is still a non lethal threat. I don't want to deal with rashes or cold sores if I can easily avoid it. To clarify I meant I was placed in danger of unnecessarily contracting a life long discomfort. Yes, there are treatments to make it easier to deal with. Why should I have to subject myself to that because of some asshole I barely know?

3) To Isaac Jiali Bi and those who were out to provide education: I'll review some of the statistics given by you all. ""Herpes is extremely common, 67% of adults have it globally."" ""~90% of people have type 1 and/or type 2"" ""About one in eight people ages 14-49 in the United States have genital HSV-2 infection."" ""1 in 5 men have it and 1 in 4 women have it."" 

Although I appreciate your attempts to provide education literally none of you agree with each other on statistics.

Furthermore how are these statistics supposed to help me? My case is a very specific situation where my partner has a 100% chance of having type 1 herpes that spread to her vagina.

4) If made aware of my partner's status earlier would I have had sex with her? No. The  comments shaming me for this decision are uncalled for. We live in a society where we are trying to move towards women feeling comfortable rejecting sex in any situation possible and having their partner being okay with this. I'm in full support of this mindset. As such I also deserve the right to only consent to sexual situations I am comfortable with. Some people may have the preference to have sex with someone who is knowingly positive for herpes. I choose differently. This is not a decision that is up for debate because a decision to withhold consent is not debatable.

5) To Travis Gilbert and –ò–¥–∞ –•–∞—á–∞—Ç—É—Ä—è–Ω—Ü: You two voiced many of my thoughts and feelings on this. I completely agree with everything you said. Thank you for standing up for me.

6) The fact that I feel I need to defend myself not wanting to contract and deal with an STD is outrageous. Is it possible and normal to live a healthy life with herpes? Yes. But who the hell actually wants herpes? The real issue here is that I had a shitty and untrustworthy partner and somehow my views on consent and acceptance are being questioned. I'm the victim here. Not her.",,"serious, nsfw",

After not getting a response from my ""thanks for being cool about things, how's your break going if you don't mind me asking"" text, my first guess was that they felt uncomfortable telling me that continued friendship was out of the question after I revealed my feelings (and I didn't read them acting cool initially as their way of possibly making it easier due to my own lack of experience.) Still, they haven't deleted/unfollowed me, they're usually in the seen list on my stories (could just be a result of a skip showing as seen), and our common friends are not treating me any differently. We're both graduating in two months and the odds of us speaking to each other again after that are not even minuscule. For me, the thought of that fateful finals week marking the end of us knowing each other hurts, but that's probably just because I'm not jaded enough yet. I know that it's a bit selfish of me to see if we're still cool by going with a ""how's your quarter going"" message or just being honest about the thought I mentioned, but I'm considering it. I have gotten so used to letting things go unresolved because of being scared and taking the initiative to possibly get one last bit of closure might be a good step for me. On the other hand, it's also possible that I should just take this as my first definitive heartbreak, disassociate, and take note of what I learned for the future.

Don't go on sapphic tinder to find women for a threesome if it involves a man. Women looking for women on tinder are not looking for a man. This is especially shitty if you hide the fact that you are unicorn hunting from them by just having yourself on the profile. There are websites and apps specifically for threesomes and for people looking to join a couple. Sapphic tinder is not it. 

Feeld is a really popular threesome app, and Mixxxer, and I'm sure fetlife could be used for that as well, try those instead of bothering the queer women on tinder. (Or tbh other regular dating sites like okcupid and oh my god please dont unicorn hunt for a threesome with your boyfriend on HER like goddamn)

There. Good luck finding someone to join you. Also, consider swinging, that way it's two established couples and there's no weird power dynamic at play.

and so the trashcan in my room was my only option, but the plastic bag in the trashcan was a ralph's bag and not the hdh one, so it wasn't fulling wrapping around the opening. finally everything in my intestines exploded. relief hits me. i soon look down and see i had missed the entire plastic bag, and now elephant shit sat at the bottom of hdh's poor property. the flavor..",,nsfw,

You don't rub soap in your eyes, you just gently clean the area around them because the eyes are self cleaning, just like the coochie!

11285,2019-04-16 17:28:08,"So there's been more confessions about KOTX recently and I just wanted to share my thoughts and personal experience with the org. Lemme start by saying I am not a part of their staff nor was I told to make this post. (It's not Guerrilla* marketing yo)

As a freshman, going to library walk is like a key thing to do right?? and to try and join as many orgs as I could so I can get a feel of the different people and see who I vibe with? I remember seeing one group on triton day and I immediately when to their booth or tent or whatever its called lol and was immediately ignored. I was told to just fill out stuff on a laptop and the people went back to talking to their other friends behind the table. I ignored that and hoped maybe things would be different if I went to the GBM. Nope same thing. I thought okay it's because I am an introvert and just don't vibe with these people. that's okay.

I tried joining another org (which I've realized that it's a good thing I didn't join not gonna call peoples directly out cause that aint cool) and that didn't go so well. I showed up to an event where they were having free food and I went around 30 mins after it started and people were still eating and talking, and I was told oh the events over and that was pretty much it. The food wasn't even the main reason I showed up like actually the org was full of people who I thought I was gonna really vibe with but again guess not. 

Then I found KOTX with my friend. The people were friendly at the booth. That was a good start. Went to a GBM and they were really fun. I was with my friend that time, but she couldn't go to their next event but I wanted to go cause I thought this org would be the one. So, me being the introverted and anti-social af person I am, was surprised that I went to their bonfire. And even more shockingly was warmly welcomed and even met some of my close friends there. I went from knowing no one to literally spending 75% of my time with all of these people. I'm still shocked cause nani the fuck im so awkward and introverted its gross

So maybe I truly didn't vibe with other groups, but it definitely isn't because I'm introverted. KOTX may not be for everyone, but give it more than one chance imo. In my experience, KOTX isn't as clique or clicky(?) (idk how to spell) as many make it out to be. It's definitely not the cliquest org out there.

11284,2019-04-16 16:21:57,"PSA:

In this day and age, going outside is sometimes risky.  A new thing that‚Äôs been going on is people getting into fake Ubers and getting assaulted.  As a result I feel the need to make a PSA on how to avoid having that happen to you

1) Alright so the first tip is pretty straightforward.  So every car has these plates on the front and back with numbers and letters identifying them called ‚Äúlicense plates‚Äù.  Now not many people know this but Uber actually displays the license plate of the car that‚Äôs meant to pick you up.  So what you want to do is when you‚Äôre about to get picked up, you open the Uber app, look at the license plate of the car of your driver, then look to see if the car you‚Äôre about to get into has that number.  If you do this I can guarantee you‚Äôll get into the right car every time.

2) Now let‚Äôs say that‚Äôs a bit too difficult for you.  Maybe you‚Äôre here going ‚ÄúAre you serious?  7 digits and letters?  I can‚Äôt remember those:‚Äù well the good thing is I have another failsafe tip.  In addition to giving license plate numbers, Uber actually provides you with the physical appearance of the car.  So if for whatever reason you can‚Äôt compare license plate numbers, you can just look to see if the car you‚Äôre getting into matches the description of the car on the app.

3) Alright this final tip is actually quite complicated and should only be used as a last resort should the first two methods fail.  So if the license plate trick and the car trick both don‚Äôt work you‚Äôll have to do a visual comparison of the driver.  First you look at the pic of the driver in your Uber app then look at the driver of the car you‚Äôre about to step into.  If they look like the same person then get in.

I hope you have all found this PSA informative.  Stay safe everyone",,serious,

I regained the ability to cry last year, and since then, I rarely go more than a week without crying. I have trouble falling into a deep sleep and usually can't fall asleep until 3 at the very earliest, an issue which probably doesn't help low moods (likely related, though.) For a while, depression and burnout from life in general had kind of taken away my ability to feel sad. Self-loathing bred passive resignation, particularly in regards to whether I was capable of being loved or receiving affection. Now, though, matters of love are playing a part in my becoming reacquainted with sadness. When I see people in relationships, I yearn for the little things. My suite-mate and their SO brush their teeth together, often laughing alongside each other. I don't want to admit it, but my heart kind of hurts when I see it. It's not a feeling of resentment, just a sense of sorrow about not sharing that bond with another person. I don't care about holding hands for appearances sake (showing someone off to aid my ego), but I yearn for the feeling of knowing someone who would see my hand as one worth holding. Trying to do little things to put myself out there, but I don't know how to not look distressed. I cherish my friends and like what I do, so I have other sources of refuge to help me as I work through a lot of underlying issues at least. It doesn't make the loneliness any less painful, but I know that it is okay to feel sad and I'll take sadness over bitterness or self-pity any day. ",,sad,

11248,2019-04-14 17:22:38,"Hey, @#11111 this is #8739, personally when I sleep with no underwear, I mean nakey from waist down, but you can sleep in a long skirt if you are concerned about flashing your roomies (that's what I do). I think boxers might be okay, but tbh I don't like shorts on my bare coochie. 

The yeast infection pills are really hardcore, and you might get into a yoyo cycle with them, especially if you are prone to  yeast infections. I definitely recommend the cream (clotrimazole) instead, though it gets a bit messy (you can wear pads, or, again, long skirts with no underwear)

if you put time into your cooter's health (such as sleeping with no undies on CONSISTENTLY, hydrating, avoiding sweets, eating plain yogurt, etc), you will reduce the chance of developing a yeast infection in the first place, rather than mitigating the symptoms. 

Another thing that can cause yeast infections is shaving, because it can be irritable (those are usually gonna be external yeast infections that you want to treat with cream, not pills), so if you can, avoid shaving and try to trim instead, or use products made for sensitive skin, and specifically for the bikini line. (I also heard waxing might work, but I have never gotten waxed)

I really hope this gets posted ASAP so you can read this advice, and I hope it's helpful <3",,,

They broke up and our friendship became closer but while I knew that her character (like ambition or empathy levels) wasnt the best fit to mine (I would care too much she would care too little about things; I loved to try new things she hated doing that stuff) our hobbies and everything else matched and we've had lots of fun times and laughed together. When we first met we had an almost fwb start; we didnt have sex or anything but I've felt up her boobs and she's touched my dick and we enjoyed cuddling a lot. Then we stopped once she got a boyfriend but we still maintained our friendship. I feel that now that I've known her for so long, I've grown past the lust part of our friendship and love her wholeheartedly. Sometimes though, when she talks about getting another boyfriend, I catch myself thinking ""I can be your ideal boyfriend."" But realistically I know that our relationship wouldnt last because our personalities are so different and I'm also scared to tell her because I dont want to ruin what we have; it's gotten me through a lot and she's really been a beacon of support, despite how many times I have to bother her to try going out her comfort zone or to even help me with a chore here or there. It's tough because other than the personality clashes, she's my ideal type and I just love *her*. I love her smile and how her eyes light up; how elegant she looks when she crosses her legs. I love how she can be totally wacky and say some really random things sometimes and how we can laugh about the weirdest stuff together. But I know if we were to get into a relationship I've friendzoned myself so hard at this point that it's would be completely one-sided. I used to see her message her boyfriend all thr time and she would be sending him pictures and videos and messaging him all the time. I dont think she would go as far for me. Like yes I do get stuff, but not to the same level as her boyfriend, whom she loved. After they broke up, when she talks about her I get a little uncomfortable because one, ik she be lying cuz I talked to the dude, and we're homies and some things did not actually happen lol. But also it was just weird but not painful to picture her together with him. So I'm very confused about my feelings.

With the juice world tindr thing, our friend group has enjoyed being on tindr. Recently, we just made hers and while it was fun swiping with her, when she told me that she was kinda excited at the prospect of being in a relationship again i was a little sad.

One night as I was walking home from school kinda late cause of MESA (where my MESA peeps at???), I saw this one dude lying on the floor with his face down. The dude looked knocked the fuck out. There were two people standing over his body. Thees two people were yelling at each other or something like that (dont really remember, they were fighting for sure though). And all of a sudden BAAAAM! one of em kicks the dude lying on the floor and that dude DEAD FUCKING ASS spinned an entire 90 degree angle! NO JOKE! 90 fucking degrees. The torque from the kick straight up made his entire body rotate a right fucking angle! After the guy kicked the dude on the floor, he books it outta there so fast. I start walking faster too cause im scared shitless. 
The next thing you know... the other dude that was also standing goes into the his small little key smith shop. The kicker guy already ran past me, I turn around to see whats going on with the dude on the floor, and the guy that went into the key smith shop... OMFG I ran SOO FUCKING FAST after I saw what he was pointing with in my direction at the kicker dude. He came out with a fucking gun. He didnt shoot though thank god!

11138,2019-04-12 19:09:31,"So I had an idea and would love some feedback. 

There are a lot of great clubs on campus that students can involve themselves where they can grow in their field and become a part of a community but the biggest problem is that not many people know about them. Why?
   
Because it takes a lot of effort and talent to actually make good flyers to catch people's attention but members, let's say in a specific engineering club, won't necessarily have the spare time or Photoshop/editing skills to get in done nicely.   

That's why I want to propose a program which UCSD should start where students who are majoring in Visual Arts and have experience in media, photography, and graphic design etc. can join these clubs specifically for the purpose of designing  and managing these recruitment materials (flyers, website, facebook page) in exchange for 1 unit of credit per quarter. 

It's a win/win situation because these students can build up their portfolio, gain experience working with teams and get credit to graduate, while the club gets an established on-campus and online presence. 

What do you guys think? Is this a good program for UCSD to consider?",[redacted],,

A short time ago, I fell fairly hard for this lady who I see precisely twice a week for a total of four hours per week. She is a (very senior) member of the club I am in and I never ever see her anywhere outside of club meetings ever. We never really talk during the club meetings because most of the biweekly two hour meetings are devoted to club business and because she typically walks in late and/or leaves immediately after the meetings end. And when we do have free time before/during/after the meetings themselves, I never really have an opportunity to engage her because she's typically engaged with all of the other senior club people (since they're all really close friends outside of the club) and it would just be horribly awkward and rude if I cut off or butted into their conversation. We share no classes together, nor do we ever bump into each other on campus, so there's never really been a chance for spontaneous conversation to occur. I've never been particularly concerned about initiating and maintaining the conversation, since I'm a pretty good conversationalist and so is she (from what I can infer) and we both have fairly similar interests (more similar than practically all my previous crushes). We're also connected to one another on Messenger and Instagram, but I sense I wouldn't have much success by going the inbox route, since she is busy ad perpetuum (coursework, club work, and work work too, I'd presume). Also I haven't the slightest clue about where I'd even begin, how I'd initiate conversation online considering we still don't know each other very well (although luckily we aren't strangers). At this point, I don't know what to do. I feel like I've reached my wit's end. It's gotten to the point where I am beginning to fervently hope/pray for some kind of break, anything at all, any chance encounter or opportunity anywhere. I understand that things like this happen and them's the breaks, but it's still so incredibly frustrating. Irrespective of what happens though, I'm still gonna shoot my shot, since I haven't a thing to lose by doing so. And I understand that irrespective of how much foundation I build up between her and myself, she may still shoot me down for reasons that are totally beyond my control (or alternatively, she may accept simply out of interest). It's just that I want to reduce the probability of being shot down (however great that may be) as much as possible (however much that amount may be).

~~~~~~~~~~~
I am working on starting a new student publication and am recruiting a staff or contributors to write about the question of what it means to be a college student.
College appears singular and monolithic to those who are outside of it. Unavoidably, we hold this viewpoint before we enter college, and often pick it up once again after we have long forgotten about all of our experiences. For four years, however, we know that the collegiate experience is ultimately a complicated, holistic and imperfect process.
We can pen a deeper reflection of all the personal stories, ideas, and experiences which come together and describe the college experience. What are those issues which make college at UCSD unique? To me, this ends up being Geisel, food, our international student body, and our (soon to be) seven colleges: we seem to be cursed with bad food on our campus, I wonder if our large international student body obligates us to greater degrees of inclusion and integration, and finally, how will the Chancellor‚Äôs plans to eventually guarantee four-year housing change campus life? These are some of the questions I hope to pursue with a dedicated and intelligent staff or thoughtful contributors.",[redacted],,

This school has a way of normalizing every individual into a number and spitting out odds of getting into graduate school, a career, etc. Is it good to be realistic and pragmatic? Without a doubt. Is it good to let statistics and averages determine whether or not you can do something? I'm not so sure. There's a reason interviews and essays exist; every individual is a unique human being that has capacity to contribute, and no amount of grades or test scores can hamper that.

11110,2019-04-11 16:48:28,"Continuation of #10893: To clarify, getting good grades and having a high MCAT score is important, no doubt. Academics are the basis of any graduate school and are important. But those two things by themselves don't make you stand out in any capacity, because like I said, most applicants all have great scores. Medicine is about so much more than just being ""smart""; you're devoting a huge chunk of your life (arguably your prime years) to helping people (note this is not restricted to pre-meds, this applies to nurses, midwifes, public health majors, etc.  ). If you're going into healthcare, you need to be a well-rounded and passionate individual; again, good grades and MCAT in this example are great, but not sufficient. I feel like I came off as a butthurt jealous pre-med so I should clarify my GPA is about average and my MCAT score is above average, so I'm no academic stud myself. Despite that, I devoted a LOT of hours pursuing projects and organizations that I am passionate about and love spending time on.

Clarified point of my confession: work hard and do your best in academics, don't let them define you. AND MOST IMPORTANTLY: do what you love, enrich your soul with things that excite you, it's good for your health and well-being and will show in your interviews and get you into your school of dreams <3",,pre-med,

11102,2019-04-11 14:32:12,"I was close to giving up on tinder during winter quarter because I actually don't like having one-night-stands and I had a falling out with someone. Recently, I'm particularly interested in one guy who is pretty new to tinder. The first time we met, we got to know each other, and I was a little surprised to hear that he didn't have that much experience with sex. Like Idk, he's a solid 8 or 9 and he's a whole foot taller than me. Anyways, after we had sex, he told me that he really liked being with me and that he didn't want to just leave right after because he didn't want me to feel used. When he said those words, it really made me happy because I just want a relationship with some substance. Of course, it's too soon to say that we'll turn into something serious, but him saying that gave me a lil hope. 
He's also super affectionate, and I kinda forgot how much I liked hugs and soft pecks until he came along. Actually, I tend to be uncomfortable/tense around new people, but I feel very comfortable with him physically. Like his embrace is just very comforting and addictive. SO the combination of the fact that we vibe pretty well, his particularly pleasant affection, and his somewhat wholesome intentions has got me pretty hooked. 
3 or 4 days after we meet, he hits me up first and we end up talking and cuddling for a few hours. He tells me that he got out of a relationship before spring break, and he kinda told me that he didn't think we were anything serious. Idk if he meant that he didn't want to, but yea it was a little discouraging ngl. BUT I can understand why he's more hesitant to jump into something. He did share that he just hated being lonely, so I think we're on the same page in that sense. After that, we rambled on about other stuff, and he started to get sleepy. He really wanted me to stay the night, but I wasn't down because I had an 8 am. He told me again that he thinks that we get along really well for some reason. Before I left, he hugged me for a long time and told me that he liked being with me.
Since then, I can't get him out of my mind. Like damn I don't wanna be a sucker for words, but now I smile whenever I think about him. Despite all that sweet stuff, I am also trying to not be invested in case he loses interest and finds another girl. This has happened to me two or three times, so I'm just worried that this is gonna be that same situation. I want to keep seeing him, but I'm feeling insecure about us as well.

I am disgusted by how easy it was to play the graders for my DEI course.
So I having had more than 12 units that quarter, decided to take my DEI for pass no pass just to have one less course to worry about. 
So on one assignment, I straight up didn't read it, so what I did was I read the title, and the first 2 or 3 sentences of each paragraph just to kind of get an idea of what was happening. and just related it to me being Asian and my ""struggles"" that I heavily exaggerated and made analogous to the topic, and got an A on it. So again, I'm Asian, and the TA responsible for grading me was a white woman. So what I did was I played around with her, and tried writing things with the same strategies and noticed that all it took was relating to how things are either problems for women, or problems for Asians. The reason for this strategy was because I believed that she would appreciate me exaggerating women's problems that don't really exist, and that she felt she couldn't challenge me on my bullshit because she doesn't know what it's like to be Asian. and sadly to say it did work. and just to really confirm it, I tried one paper where I actually did read the readings, and objectively wrote about it and then changed gears and undermined the women's issue that was being discussed, and got a bad score on it. 

And the reason I decided to write this now is because I did get a full time job. and Nothing I've learned in my DEI is worth a fuck to the company nor to me.

and so I can fairly say that the DEI was a waste of my time and money. and fuck you UCSD for making me take it.

11076,2019-04-10 15:32:22,"Hi everyone, op of 10906 and 8739 back again for my yeasty coochie pals. 

For those concerned about my yeasty coochie, don't worry, in fact I wrote up confession 8739 to share tips of how I got the croissant factory under control! (And yes, yeast is used in croissants üòâüòé)

Another thing I wanted to note is: most coochie people lean one way or the other (yeasty or bacteria pals), and that's okay! Sometimes our immune system gets weakened and we have itchy times. That's nothing to be ashamed of, and bakery coochie smell is something I can be positive and jokey about to reduce insecurity during itchy times. 

Coochies aren't supposed to smell like flowers, and douching is really bad for them, and I'll take buttery croissant smell over a pH imbalance any day ‚ù§

And if it makes even one person feel a little less insecure about their coochie, I'm happy to keep blogging my yeasty journey üòÉ",,nsfw,

Little did I know of just how sus, crazy and fake she is. Like I never really noticed certain things about her, but the longer I lived with her, the more and more I started disliking her. She always tries to be the center of attention, never apologizes even though she knows shes in the wrong, tries to victimize herself in every situation as to seem that she didn't do anything wrong, and all around fake. She would also have a different problem everyweek and would be in a depressed mood, we would try to help her out but she literally had a new problem each week so we just grew tired of trying to even help her, seeing as though she rarely listen to our advices or is even appreciative of it. Its not just me either, some of our other friends that knows about the situation also have started to dislike her, but those that doesn't know still adore her and doesn't think anything wrong of her. I dont want to ruin their image of her because I don't think its my place to tell them what to think of a person but I also think its unfair that they hold her on this pedestal and believe her to be this great person.

I don't really know what to do. I know that she has some mental issues (depression, suicidal thoughts) and by pushing her away more I feel like it might get worse for her. Like I said, some of our mutual friends have also distanced themselves from her too so she doesn't have the support system that she used to have but also I don't want to be fake. I don't want to pretend that I'm there for her when I'm not anymore or that everything is fine and dandy. We already rarely talk anyways even though we share the same room, but I still have a whole quarter to live with her and it just seems my home has become an unwelcoming environment.

[trigger warning]
Unrelated to why I dislike her now, but I think she might be gay. She had this weird fascination with one of our girl friend (which i think she liked) and ever since our friend got a boyfriend she started acting worse. Not really sure if its the case or not, but it might explain why my roomate was so obsessive with our friend and literally centered a lot of her problem around our friend.

11065,2019-04-09 22:54:35,"@10846 saying you‚Äôd rather a flat out rejection from girls instead of them trying to let you down nicely, it‚Äôs tough to do since from my experience, guys can take it quite personally. For example, once I was in a friend group where there was only 1 other girl and 6 other guys, we were all friends but the guys were closer. One of them liked me, I tried letting him down nicely and curving him pretty obviously, and when I eventually flat out rejected him he was all ‚Äú_______ is a bitch, she‚Äôs a hoe anyways, she wears too much makeup i probably wouldn‚Äôt recognize her if we were dating and she got too comfortable and showed me her bare face‚Äù etc etc. really mean and hurtful things, and it influenced the way the other guys in our friend group saw me and they all stopped talking to me. 

I think a lot of girls feel this way, even if it might not be exactly like my situation i mentioned. Guys get hurt when they‚Äôre flat out rejected, and then they talk shit about the girl just for not reciprocating feelings. Sure, not all guys are like that, but how can we tell if they are or aren‚Äôt? Guys will be very sweet to a girl they‚Äôre interested in and then, like a switch, they suddenly become assholes when they realize she doesn‚Äôt feel the same. If they‚Äôre only pretending to be nice so that we like them back, we can‚Äôt tell if they‚Äôre genuinely the type to handle the rejection well or not. ",,,

Fuck you and your dumb snapchats about our history. I know you too well and I know every post is about me I know because I used to do the same... but you know what I grew up. 
I got over my issues of relationships and trust and started to let you in. It was going okay and then you stopped fighting right after I stepped in the ring. 

You were my best friend and maybe you knew it or maybe not but you were when I was happiest and even if my fear took over and I moved on you never gave up.    Even after you moved 3000 miles away thats when it was strongest. And no I couldnt do long distance even if we only saw each other a few times that summer you still loved me and that became my anchor.

No i couldnt say it back quite yet but I did eventually and things went slow, you went to school closer to me but still a few states away but it was always enough to keep me holding on. Sometimes the thought of you was the only thing I had because it was a constant like pi or the speed of light. 

And no we were not in a relationship but I couldnt date anyone else and you knew that and I knew you wouldnt. But you didnt trust me did you you never asked?  

If youve gotten this far there were a lot of nos above but a lot of yeses as well a lot of memories - and then you stopped, the letters that warmed my heart and the phone calls I waited for every night. So when finals got me busy and I was feeling down and I couldnt talk to you and you broke it off and cut me out you cannot weep and pull me back with your pathetic excuse for a message over your snapchat story. Have you tried to call me? Explain things? No instead you cant understand how heart broken and plain broken I am 

Ha i guess my friend was right and you just wanted me for sex in the end.

We've met before but I didn't really feel a connection back then (and I didn't see how our schedules would allow things to work out). So, I instead worked on improving myself and put myself out there more. Being a new quarter, I felt rather hopeful at our following meetup, but she seemed WAY MORE occupied, especially with an SO who took her out often. At the moment, I was stunned because I didn't know whether to still try to spend time getting to know her despite her SO or to move on completely (which is what I did and felt was the better option).

10904,2019-04-05 17:55:41,"Autistic person here (not in the way that edgelord assholes mean, can't believe people still say that shit in 2019.) Reading rooms and cues is something that I have to constantly practice, so I veer towards over-analysis and being cautious as a general rule of thumb. This keeps me out of sticky situations, but it also deters me from taking potentially positive risks. I have some great friends, but my circle is relatively limited and I am not one to put myself out there. After getting past the mental hurdle of telling someone else that I have feelings for them (didn't work out and that's okay), I have found myself feeling noticeably more attracted to people in general and it's really confusing. My game-spitting skills are non-existent. I can't tell when or if someone is sending me signals and miss on potential opportunities to spark up conversations or flirt a bit. For example, a person smiled at me and said they recognized me from a class before asking me about how the final went, leading to a brief convo. They were really enthusiastic and I appreciated someone initiating a convo as simple as that, but I still came off as really shy throughout the interaction. Another time, someone poked me on the back to compliment me on something I was wearing and I said ""thank you"" with a smile before continuing to go about what I was doing. 

I am not particularly bad looking for someone so socially inept, but I worry that the combination of my shyness and my features make me look almost childlike. I feel like some people might read my shyness as an indicator of being asexual or aromantic, a feeling that only gets compounded when I tell them that I am on the spectrum. I recently created a tinder profile as a ""fuck it"" move, but I don't have any matches yet. My settings (within general campus/student life radius so it isn't all randos) may be contributing a bit, but it would suck if it's just that I am not drawing interest or am not cognizant of unreasonable standards that I might have.

11611,2019-04-05 01:20:36,"The guy who talked about the wage gap between the sexes is correct but approached the topic without any tact and also comes off as kind of a douche with a superiority complex. There are a number of reasons that women are paid less than men. Part of it is an overall genetic predisposition towards careers that are people-focused over object-focused. Part of it is outdated oppressive tactics like a glass ceiling. Part of it is that men are willing to work longer hours and ask for more raises. So on and so forth. It's a complex, multivariate issue and causality is difficult to fully determine but simply shouting ""OPPRESSION"" is as non-sensical as those shouting that ""MEN ARE BETTER"". The issue with the left is that they completely throw out science when it comes to the topic of sex/gender differences and cling to JUST oppression, when the issue is much more complicated than that. Are women discouraged from going into the STEM field and managerial/executive positions? Yes, even though I think that this is decreasing over time. That's something that we're going to have to continue to flush out as a society. Are women also genetically predisposed to jobs that are valued less within this society? The answer is: YES. There are solid, time-tested research articles done demonstrating the fact that differences in occupation between the genders RISE when countries adopt more egalitarian policies that remove societal biases towards one occupation or the other. The more pressing issue that I think is often overlooked is: Are we undervaluing the positions that women tend to adopt in our society? I think we are. The real systemic bias lies in this issue. Why are elementary school teachers paid such dismal rates when they're educating future generations? Why are counselors paid such dismal rates when they're taking care of the mental health of current and future youth in a time of skyrocketing anxiety, depression and self-harm rates? THIS should be the focus of discussion because it addresses a large part of the wage gap that exists within this country without forcing a particular career choice for women. 

I think the wage gap between jobs is honestly overstated. Coming from a simple logical perspective, in a competitive economy, why would business owners hire men if they can pay women 78 cents to the dollar for the same value of work? Do you know how hard it is to start or even run a business? Do you know how much overhead that business owners could save by adopting to a female-only workforce if this was true? Let's re-introduce some reasoning into this argument because it's a damn complicated problem that won't be addressed by the fucking monkey approach we have now. Let's talk about the real issues and not parrot the oppression-narrative OR the male superiority-narrative. ",,serious,

10807,2019-04-04 11:25:03,"Sometime ago took working out very seriously, I was a skinny guy trying to get more muscular. I would eat as much as I could, drown myself in protein shakes and workout religiously. And the best part was I was seeing great results, I was becoming more muscular and starting to fill out my cloths. But one thing no one ever tells you about eating a lot of protein or a lot in general is the incessant flatulence you accrue. Fast forward to the start of a quarter, I had a writing class around noon of that day so I figured I could get a quick workout in. I hit up Rimac, got that sick pump bro and went home as fast as possible to take advantage of that anabolic window. I sloshed together the most putrid yet protein and calorie dense shake UCSD has ever known. I pinched my nose and knocked back the vile gains elixir. I had 15 minutes left before the start of the writing class so I changed and ran over. I found a middle seat and the class started on time. The professor began going over the syllabus and eventually requested we write a little about ourselves and turn it in before leaving. It had been a little over an hour since I had the shake, and at this point my GI tract was wrenching, bloating, contorting and growing. I was immediately trapped. I was frozen in my seat; the reality of what may happen struck me all at once. I ordered my rectum to batten down the hatches, shut the sphincter, all hands on the poop deck.

1.) Be considerate and fill up the INSIDE seats first so other students can sit down easier. If for some reason you need to sit at the edge seats, scoot your backpack under your chair. 

2.) When a lecture hall is full and there are people sitting on the stairs, you shouldn't save seats. ""first come, first serve"" doesn't apply when there is a 10 minute window from the previous lecture for all students to find a seat. 

3.) Do not enter a lecture hall, until the previous lecture is 80% vacated. As much as your passion to learn is admirable, it's absolutely rude to shove your way into a FULL lecture hall. Form a line or group away from the exits of the lecture hall so students can leave safely and efficiently.

Basically, anyone who comes into my life and does something meaningful will get their song (or a bunch of songs if they're super special) and the lyrics or the mood of the song doesn't have to match what the person did. This also happens to me with places I visit, and any specific memories. It's so weird to the extent I might not have heard a song in 15 years and once I do, I remember exactly where I was when I heard it, when, what I was doing, as long as it's linked to a memory (eg roadtrip with my dad at night coming back from a certain place when I was 5). It's kinda cool if you ask me, but it can also get really bad an depressing. Eg. Not being able to dance to a song at the club because my memory linked to it would be of a guy I considered my friend sexually assaulting me. I will sometimes go in a restaurant and the background music will drive me to tears, or make me feel butterflies based on what is playing. I know some songs will make you remember things and it's normal, but my brain has made this my default setting for storing memories.

10822,2019-04-03 01:54:47,"Hey, so there have been recent posts about fat people. I really don't take offense to these post because I know I'm fat and would never consider myself curvy. I do believe that America's body positivity has taken a turn where obesity should be accepted but it kinda shouldn't. Being obese fucking sucks, not for looks (you are beautiful), but for health. I had a diabetes scare that really put shit into perspective. I know I can make myself beautiful with the right clothes and makeup but that will not make up for the fact that my health is in decline. 

However, there is a reason on how I got myself to be this. During middle school I was actually an average weight but I got depressed and found comfort in food when I couldn't it find in others. It took me awhile to just accept the fact that I'm fat. 

The type of ""harsh"" comment was made but it won't actually do anything. Only skinny people would agree with you (with the exception of me) and others would go agaisnt you. Fat people may call themselves curvy in order to cover the blow of being fat, but it is better promote workouts and diets than degrading fat people.

Degrading people just makes the people hate you and go against you. 

If I'm going to kill myself due to obesity at least let me die peacefully. I get that you might be ""concerned"" but in all honesty just let me walk with a crop top, with my Dora the Explorer belly without having to be concerned of being an eyesore for others.",[redacted],,

So I have these two really close friends and we‚Äôve known each other for about a three years (?). We‚Äôre about 21/22 years old but I‚Äôve been having communication issues with the both of them. 

So I‚Äôm from LA and I recently moved to San Diego to attend university so I understand that it was inevitable that we would communicate less

With one of the friends, I understand why I get slow responses from her Bc she has work and school and a bf etc etc so we generally talk at the end of the day or sometimes about once a week and it‚Äôs great. 

The other friend however, I just feel like he‚Äôs never there anymore? And he‚Äôs by no means ‚Äòbusy‚Äô whatsoever. Yes, he does attend school but that‚Äôs simply it. Of course whatever classes he‚Äôs taking may be difficult for him and maybe that‚Äôs why he doesn‚Äôt message back until 12 hours later but I just don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs why. He also doesn‚Äôt go out much. If he was out with his friends, then I‚Äôm not expecting him to message me back soon all the time but i know that he rarely goes out. When he‚Äôs not at school, he‚Äôs at his house playing games/ procrastinating from homework. 

If I message him about something that‚Äôs annoying me from a certain professor (or something), I don‚Äôt hear from this friend for basically 10-12 hours. But when I have gossip or something about an ex or whatever, he messages back instantly. 

I‚Äôm definitely not asking for him to be messaging me back instantly all the time. I mean even I can‚Äôt do that Bc I do have classes and exams but idek. I know in general he spends a lot of time on his phone A LOT, so I know he‚Äôs getting my messages and just choosing not to message back. 

It doesn‚Äôt help that when he wants to text me about help on his homework or something that‚Äôs going on in his life, he‚Äôll spam my phone and then call me if I don‚Äôt respond right away. 

One time, he spammed my phone about fifteen minutes before I was about to take a final to ask for homework help and when I wasn‚Äôt responding, he called and wouldn‚Äôt let me hang up until I helped him. And his assignment was going to be due in two hours, so it also makes me angry that he sees me as a person who needs to be at his ‚Äòservice‚Äô because of his poor time management, yet he can‚Äôt be there for me when I‚Äôm feeling upset or excited about something (which is also super rare, I‚Äôm not one to be complaining about everything or gush about everything. I usually take some time to think about things and contemplate whether or not, it‚Äôs worth my time to be upset/ excited). 

It‚Äôs just that recently I feel like when I‚Äôm feeling super excited about something or super upset about something, I don‚Äôt really have people to turn to anymore. ITs different to tell a story 12 hours later because the peak of my emotion (whether it be excitement or anger) is gone. It just simply becomes a story. 

I‚Äôve made friends at university but I‚Äôm not as close to them in comparison to these two ones from LA so it can be a little difficult to be telling them things as well. ",,,

But actually going through that, i know exactly how scary having that much hate is. Which is why i want nothing but love, kindness and selflessness for one another. to as many people as possible. at least the best that we can do since hate and anger and irritation are very human emotions. 
also, i recently picked up writing short stories. the mom becoming homeless (i dont have a title yet) one is my first completed story. Its still just a first draft! any criticism or advice, or other similar writings would be greatly appreciated! Im a stem major so i dont get to read english literature that often. ",,storytime,
10692,2019-04-02 02:45:39,"One night in the Summer I finished fifth grade, my mom became homeless‚Ä¶ It was that night I knew exactly what hate felt like. You don‚Äôt know what hate is until you‚Äôve been in a kitchen at four or five in the morning when your dad is finally knocked out from all the booze and porn he edits and watches in the same tiny ass room as you, your sister, and your mom. Until you‚Äôve held a knife, clutching it with all your strength just wanting to pierce it through his heart. 

Hate doesn‚Äôt start off that way though. It doesn‚Äôt because it‚Äôs a gradual build. 

Dad first hits your mom. You‚Äôre just a little boy, terrified of what you just saw. Confused even. Almost all the movies you watched and all your friends‚Äô families growing up had loving parents who cared for each other. 

Then dad starts to hit your mom even harder, and he starts to hit you. Now, you‚Äôre kept up all night just daydreaming about grabbing that knife, but you can‚Äôt. You don‚Äôt have the guts to do it. I don‚Äôt think anyone ever has the guts to do it. 

He keeps hitting you, your mom, and now your sister. He still drinks. He still edits and watches porn in front of you and says nothing but insults to you. At this point, you can‚Äôt help but sit up, lie down, sit up, lie down, sit up, lie down, sit up, lie down. Just thinking of the consequences of murder. Then one night you find yourself standing with your fist clenched so tight you can break dad‚Äôs neck. Then at the kitchen door with your hands on the knob, going through all the possible scenarios. All you want to do is punch a giant fucking hole in that door.

Then finally. My mom comes home late from her closing shift at the restaurant. I still don‚Äôt know what they were fighting about (or what they ever fought about) to this day because I can barely speak Korean. All I know is that this was the fight that almost ended my entire life and his. 

The fight ended with dad throwing our mini foldable table at my mom and grabbing her by the ear or hair dragging her on the floor out of our tiny room and out of the house. I‚Äôve never wondered what the other tenants of the house were doing or thinking, while listening to dad yell, hearing me and my sister cry our asses off, and probably trying to block out my mom‚Äôs screams and pleas, until now as I‚Äôm writing this. It‚Äôs kind of weird. Although I now wish someone had come help us, I‚Äôm glad no one did. This night made us stronger and more prepared for what‚Äôs to come. 

He comes back, slams the door, and sits down at his desk. He doesn‚Äôt say a single word. I looked at my sister and I will never forget how frightened and angry she looked. I was waiting for her to stand up, grab me, and walk outside to be with our mom. It never happened. We never talked about this night, but I can only assume she was waiting for me too. Dad finally turns around and tells us to not even dare help our mom. Neither of us did, and she was forced to sleep on the balcony stairs right outside the window of our room. All I could do was look up at the window from the floor. I couldn‚Äôt look any closer because I was too scared to see my mom actually outside. I stared at the window, the floor, the window, the floor, the window until dad finally laid his blankets on the floor right in front of me and fell asleep. This was the night I skipped all the indecisiveness, the reasoning, and the daydreaming. This was the night I went straight to the knife. 

As you can tell, I couldn‚Äôt find the guts to do it that night since I‚Äôm here at UCSD and not in prison. There are still some moments I wish I had done it to this day, and there are others I am glad I didn‚Äôt. 
Thanks for reading this. I know it‚Äôs very long. I‚Äôve never talked about this night and the feelings this explicitly to anyone before. I try to have nothing but love to as many people as possible, and I hope this story moves all of you to be more kind, selfless and loving to those around you. ",,storytime,

Show interest in the company and show why the company is not only a good fit for you, but why you're a good fit for them.  If you send in generic resumes/cover letters, then it's going to seem like you are just looking for money and will likely leave the company if given a better offer.  Depending on where you are applying, you may want to drop off resumes in person (especially if you are looking for a job where you would be working with customers).  Always look professional and ask to speak to a manager when dropping off the resume/cover letter.  When working over the summer, I got interviews at places I was nowhere near qualified to work.  Why?- because I had a good handshake, showed up in a suit, and showed interest in the company.  Smile too!  Too often I see people showing up to interviews in jean/without their shirts tucked in.  I graduated last year and got a job offer in the fall for $80/hour.  After being offered the position, I told the company that I'd have to think about it since I still wanted to look into other companies.  They then offered me $85.  (FYI I had no internships and only graduated with a 2.9 GPA).  Know your worth.  Play up your strengths and quantify your abilities on your resume if possible.  Also, study for your interviews!  If you can't do the harder problems, buy a book a study!  Chemists/biochemists- you should be able to make buffers!  CS majors- get a book of problems and work through them.  They will ask you similar problems.  There's only so many ways to solve these and you need to find the most efficient way.  Do practice interviews and study for your interviews like you studied for your tests.  Even better, study with friends.  If you're still struggling, consider working with a recruiter who can help prep you for interviews.  Always thank your interviewers for their time and be excited about the interviews/position.  Have your ""elevator pitch"" prepared and research the company.  Coming with questions/showing your knowledge about the company will show your interest. Spell check everything you send and have someone who knows your strengths look over it.  If you know someone good at grammar, ask him to read through your cover letter/resume.  Limit your resume to 1 page and use strong verbs on your resume.  Make sure you referrals know that you'll be using them as referrals (so that they can plan to say some nice things about you).  Don't lie on your resume! 
 If there's a skill you think you need, learn it!  Some applications will require skills that no one has (like 10 years experience with a language that's been around for 9), so still apply even if you don't meet every requirement.   Also, quantify/qualify your experience/skills (X years experience, proficient vs. advanced, etc.)   Lastly, have a professional e-mail address.  If your e-mail address is something like ""babyboi420@_________.com"", then your resume is going to be trashed right away.  Be confident and good luck everyone! :)",,advice,

10707,2019-03-31 16:04:26,"I wrote confession 10587 about telling a tour group to not attend UCSD because they will regret it. In response to the 2 white males that were upset with what I said, you're right. Instead, I should have said, ""Don't come here if you're a low income minority because this school only favors you if you are white or wealthy or both."" Honestly, I have never been so aware of colonization until I came to this stupid university. It is not a matter of taking advantage of opportunities or not, it is about the struggle with the financial aspect and the social climate, both of which have been consistently working against me. You would think that with the tuition we pay, the parking situation would be better and the food wouldn't be so damn expensive. If your parents can't afford to help you out, you are already obliged to have jobs while in school just to afford food and housing. Not to mention the social climate, I never met anyone with my same background. People always talked about how their parents went to college and are now doctors/engineers/insert other highly regarded career. I could never dream of joining a frat/sorority because it was so expensive. The pretentiousness and lack of empathy from other people from affluent backgrounds has made everything so much harder. In addition, I never once had a professor that looks like me. Even when you walk around campus, you see all the banners on those light posts with people's faces and most of them are white. It is easy to say, ""Oh, you just didn't take advantage of the opportunities"". Being so ignorant that you can easily say that sentence to someone without knowing their situation speaks volumes of the privilege that you have. You have no idea what it is like to be the first one in your family to do everything in this country and have no clue as to what you're doing, while constantly dealing with discrimination in the process. How about you check your white privilege and stop invalidating other people's experiences and emotions just because you are too privileged to even comprehend their viewpoint. Thanks.",,,

my dad died right before high school (lowkey good riddance) and since he always told me id end up homeless and a beggar cause of how stupid he thought i was, I really wanted to try hard in high school and now here i am in UCSD studying MechE with a 3.6 GPA. Hopefully i find a job after graduation.. i get hella scared my dad was right all along. he haunts the shit outta me... ghosts are fucking real yall and theyre scary af. 
in contrast tho.. my friend went to highschool with our other friends in middle scbool. most of em became drug dealers and jumped into a gang including my first friend. he recently got outta prison and we finally had a conversation after 7 or 8 years on instagram (sadly we coulsnt video chat cause my girlfriend is already sleeping.) forgot to mention he wasnt a citizen so he got deported. really glad to hear that hes really motivated to start a new life and study programming tho.

Some of them talk about history and philosophy, and I don't have the knowledge of this kind of stuff to get into the conversation, while others just come out at night to play this one game religiously at night. 
I've tried some clubs, but I feel so separated in the events and meetings. I know you are suppose to like approach people, but I don't know why people come up to me. I went to one bonfire in the first quarter and I just ended up staring out at the ocean alone for 2 hours until the bonfire ended. 
My high school friends told me I had to take initiative, but its hard when you're scared of what to say. And its so much easier for other people because they go into those clubs with other people so they feel more comfortable.
When I was hanging out with my friends over break, I told them of my problem but they say I have so much potential and i'm a good-looking guy and that I shouldn't be scared, and people would love me. During that hangout I saw someone I thought looked like my old friend from my Sunday school and she was glancing at me too. She was really pretty, but I didn't want to talk to her. But my friend went over there and asked and then dragged me over there and when I was talking to her, she seemed flustered and kept on turning to her friend and giggling? but I felt so uncomfortable despite the one asking questions and in the end I just left and I hated myself.

All my friends have like 3-5 options to choose from and I don't have anything. I submitted applications to several biotech and pharmaceutical companies through Handshake but none of them got back to me. I feel underqualified because my GPA is barely 3.0 and the only experience I have is working in an unpaid lab my first and second year. I'm so discouraged right now and I feel like I should just give up and look for something for next fall because it'll be hard for me to find an internship for the summer.... but I also really need to find something to do this summer because I don't want to go home. :(,,"serious, sad",

I really don't care if you smell like sweat, we are in a GYM but my god, whatever you were wearing was so pungent that I could barely resist the urge to gag.

I had just broken a personal best time and I was really reluctant to end my run but after about 20 minutes, I was starting to get a headache from your stench. This isn't the first time this has happened either. Ladies, (guys too but I've only experienced this with females) if you are going to workout, PLEASE don't spray an entire bottle of perfume on yourself. Better yet, don't wear any perfume or scented products at all. It is so inconsiderate and makes it really hard to do cardio workouts because breathing obviously intensifies and having to breathe in your perfume each time makes it really hard to keep working out. If you can't stand the thought of smelling like nothing when going to a gym, then can you at least go do your workout away from other people so nobody has to smell it? Like at least spray an aromatherapy oil on yourself so I can at least feel relaxed when your stench particles violate my nostrils. ",,,

If you really wanted trump impeached. You could have done it a long goddamn time ago. And the evidence for his crimes is literally public knowledge. He made an executive airstrike that killed an American 8 year old girl. he broke the emoluments clause by keeping his hotels in international countries which were then used to meet for foreign affairs with foreign officials. He used campaign money to fuck a pornstar. 

The Russia investigation wasn't at all about impeaching him. It was about the Democrats not wanting to admit they lost to trump. Well you know what, let me say it. They lost. You lost. We lost. There's no if and or buts about it. The republican party threw the election running the dumbest fucking man to have ever attempted politics, and somehow the Democrats fucked up worse and got a person that not even the Democratic firewall was willing to vote for.

And you know what, the Democratic party did deserve to lose. The country's liberal population wanted universal healthcare. You had a popular candidate that campaigned for it, and one that didn't. The DNC favored the one who didn't just because she didn't look like somebody the Republicans can easily accuse of communism and you fucking lost because of it. Plain and simple, you fucked up 

And the other thing that pisses me off the most is this. If all you needed to ""rig"" an election was russinian trollbots what does that say about the election? What does that say about your candidate if all it takes is unverified facts to make 3 states that always voted Democrats to all of a sudden vote republican? That just means your candidate SUCKED. Now if you're convinced Russia rigged the actual counts of Cotes that's a different story. But if all they did was propagate false info and that's all it took to get a turd like trump to the office then you know what, you deserved it. If you ran a likable candidate instead of trying to run some power hungry lady that's just running because she felt it was ""her turn"" after Obama, you deserve the loss. And I don't say this as a republican or a Democrat or any political party. I say this as somebody who doesn't subscribe to a party and looks at politics from a neutral point of view, nobody deserves the horror that is Donald Trump but there is no doubt in my mind that the Democratic party dug their own grave running Clinton and that's nobody's fault but theirs.",,,

My boyfriend and I recently dropped some acid after finals week to celebrate and had a pretty good time up until we decided to add some edibles to the mix. 

When the edibles hit during my trip, it felt like time itself slowed down, as well as my perception of sound. Everything looked like it was melting, almost like that one Salvador Dali painting with the clocks. When I turned to my boyfriend for help, he looked really distorted, like when Windows XP did that weird windows lag glitch. That spooked me the fuck out, along with distorted, slowed sounds and visuals ended up putting me into a scary thought loop, and eventually a horrific trip. 

During the bad trip I somehow convinced myself that my whole life was a lie and everything was fabricated by some higher being as some kind of sick joke. For 4-6 hours it felt as if I were stuck in purgatory, having repeated deja vus about finding out my life was a lie. I thought I was going to lose my mind. (tbh the experience felt like that one Naruto episode when Itachi puts Kabuto under Izanami lol)

 I think the worst part of this trip was when I thought my boyfriend and my relationship of 5 years was just a figment of my imagination. The sad thing was that I didn't want to believe that I could have possibly made this relationship up and come to terms with it. Because just the thought/idea of my boyfriend made me so happy I was willing to live and uphold that lie. 

ngl after the whole ordeal we sad and happy cried for a good hour together

On the outside, I look like I‚Äôm fine/happy but on the inside I‚Äôm just crying. Everyone struggles and fights their own battles but I just need help from someone, just someone to console me. Like when one of my suite-mates says ‚Äúgoodnight‚Äù to me, I get so fucking happy.  I‚Äôm not sure wether I should leave my contact info or not. I don‚Äôt know what the reaction to this will be. My biggest fear is that someone will figure out who wrote this and that scares me. One of my suite-mates really degrades me personally, and I feel like doing something to him. I hate being myself.  My main struggle is just being so damn lonely and not being extroverted. Ive just given up of life at this point. I over think about my flaws and all. (don't want to be specific it‚Äôll become obvs) I feel like a fucking mess who is just fucked up. I just want to cry and let my feelings out but I have no one to talk to and I feel as a guy there is a stigma associated with expressing feelings. I'm writing this at 5am crying.

For making sure I use social media to create connection, I have a few rules of thumb. They help me, I hope they help you! Share more! 
1) Would I be happier in the long-run if I told this to someone directly? It could be a deeply difficult conversation, but humans can be really good at communication when they put their hearts into it. Plus resolved conflict can bring people closer.
2) Will posting make me physically or emotionally vulnerable? You can still get hurt when you're anonymous (and damn do you guys drop personally identifiable info). Plus, commenters don't know you. You could just be joke fuel to them. Is it worth it to you to risk that instead of telling someone who knows and loves you?

No, I'm not in love with the memories, nor the idea of him, I am straight up in love with him. I no longer get sad about the relationship, and I'm over it. But over these 3 years, there hasn't been a single day I haven't thought about him, simple things like ""what is he doing?"" ""Is he having fun?"" ""I hope he's happy"". There was a time I thought I was over him, I did not love him anymore and I didn't even want to talk to him; I wasn't needy of him. You know how when you end a relationship people tend to remind you ""there's more fish in the sea"" and ""he's not the only good guy out there"" etc etc? I have actually dated a good number of guys and I can say yes, I know I'm attractive to other guys and yes, there's good guys out there. The problem is, I always end up comparing them to my ex, and as good as the guy might be he's not the guy I want. I've tried giving others a chance and no one really fulfills my needs in a partner like my ex did. How did I realize I still loved him? Possibly the hottest, sweetest guy showed the biggest level of interest in me, the guy I'd always describe when asked ""what would your perfect guy be?"" When I hung out with him I felt great, butterflies and all that stuff, but nothing close to what I felt for my ex. You can tell me my celebrity crush is head over heels with me and i'll still choose my ex over him. Now that I've come to terms with this and that it's not going away anytime soon, I just can't go out with guys, I get bored, I don't want to and I even feel guilty even though I'm single.

How should I kindly tell her that this is disturbing without sounding mean ? She comes home everyday around 7 or 8 PM or earlier. When she got home she will leave her tupperwares in one the sink compartments. Then take out the stuff she is about to cook, sometimes leaving it at the countertop for two hours. She will then go back to her room or stay at the living room watch Netflix or on phone with her friends/ family or so for an hour before going back to cooking.

10549,2019-03-25 22:25:04,"A lot on my mind so I'm just going to dump out everything I'm thinking as of this break. It's been a few years since my ex and I had parted ways, and pretty much all of the feelings have gone away now. Time really does heal, and so does getting away from their social media to not be reminded of them. Even though I don't have them on anything anymore I still feel that I care about them, but having them keep contact is too much of a burden for what it's currently worth. Sometimes I wonder how they're doing and if life has been good to them, and sometimes when I'm down I wish they had it worse than me. Regardless of what goes on I still think in my heart that they were a wonderful person during our relationship and that I wish they find happiness in what they do wherever they go. Despite our mistakes we made in high school and college I still treasure them as much as I did when we spent time together, even though I haven't talked to her in years. Recently I have been meeting new people in my clubs and other orgs too, and I think they're nice people, but it doesn't feel as warm as my first one did. I don't think I'm cut out for relationships; I feel enough fulfillment making friends that I couldn't make before. Anytime someone asks me about dating I just tell them I'm interested in someone as a placeholder.

As for my own life, as the end of my college career nears I feel more and more pressure from my family to find an internship and eventually a job. I feel as though I was never mentally prepared during admissions season in high school and if I could go back in time to replace my freshman self with me, I would save a lot of headache and disappointment to my parents. From sophomore to junior year in high school a lot of people need to make a decision that would impact how the rest of their life would play out. I wasn't ready to make such a decision then and I feel like now I'm regretting my path I've walked. A part of me tells me to get into a stable job with good security, and another part says follow a ""dream"" that could shatter as soon as my drive and ambitions do. I'm much too afraid to tell my parents that I regret my decisions, yet I still want to do my best in classes and fear failure and rejection. I'm at that point in life where many of my friends, just like many others, are going through different phases in life; getting married, getting internships/jobs, travelling the world, etc. While the only thing I've done is go to class, clubs, and a few places to travel with family. I have this unconscious benchmark of my friends' lives compared to mine and if I'm falling behind, I get scared. There are times where I wish I had the mental capacity and discipline that my friends do to go out and succeed, and live fulfilling lives. And then sometimes I wish that my parents didn't push me to go into a path that compensates satisfaction and mental well-being for stability and a good salary just to brag to family and friends during get-togethers. 

Despite all of this, I don't think I would think about committing suicide. There's still things I want to do in life, even though I feel as if I'm dragging my feet. I'm thankful for all the people I've met so far and the experiences I've gained. My one and only relationship that lasted through high school to college, although ending somewhat sourly, was something I wouldn't trade for the world. I still want to prove to my parents that I can be on my own and that coming to America wasn't in vain. I want to be a person that is successful enough to tell my kids that they can choose a path in life that they want without worry for financial problems because of my old past and parents' upbringing. I don't want to let anyone down.

I ended up losing a lot of weight but instead of anyone being concerned I was applauded for no longer being the fat girl. I would calorie count all the time.

10547,2019-03-25 18:44:01,"To start off, I‚Äôm not very good at making friends or keeping them. It just seems I make new friends at certain stages of life, then as that part passes, so do the friends (eg classes, work, roommates, etc).

Recently I met someone and we have similar interests (art, photography, hikes, etc). She just transferred and new to SD, and we chatted for like a month before meeting up for coffee. That turned into a 4 hour chat talking about ourselves, music, dating life etc. After she wanted to meet up again and we made plans to meet at a brewery.

I was late and she was waiting in her car, and it was during peak hours. I‚Äôm not into the whole bar/drinking scene, and I‚Äôve only gone to breweries during off hours like right before lunch. Anyways, obviously with so many people it was hard to make conversation. In addition, she was in a really weird mood, and after being asked, she told me that something happened and she can‚Äôt get her mind off it, and was basically texting the entire time. I tried asking what was wrong, but she didn‚Äôt want to talk about it. So I tried to make small conversations which failed because they would just end after a few sentences. In the end I suggested we leave and go our separate ways. The reason was because I felt she didn‚Äôt want to be there and she has anxiety problems and since we just met, I didn‚Äôt feel comfortable pestering her about what was wrong in fear of making her feel uncomfortable.

So a few days later she texted saying sorry for being in a weird mood, and that it‚Äôs best not to hang out again. She said after thinking it through, there was no friendship connection. At this point I‚Äôm completely confused, because I thought there was otherwise we wouldn‚Äôt have spent 4 hours talking the first time we met. I admit I did felt things were so awkward at the brewery, but I figured it was my own awkwardness, her being weird, peak hours, and the fact this was our second time hanging out.

I feel like she could‚Äôve been a really great friend, and I want to become friends. Should I attempt, and how should I suggest we grab coffee again and talk it through? Or should I just move on?",,"urgent, serious",

It's not just being sad--at least not for me. It's feeling numb and empty, not getting excited over things I know I should be excited for. It's eating food you usually like and tasting nothing. Everything is bland, and you force yourself to eat for sustenance. It's having no motivation to do even the smallest things, like getting up to shower or brushing my teeth. Like, these are basic things I know I /should/ do, but on my bad days, I can't even bring myself to do them. I can't even bother to change out of two-day-old clothes. I can't even motivate myself to eat for fuck's sake, and because of that, I feel even more disgusting and gross. And the thing that sucks is, other people probably just think I'm lazy. It gets worse when it comes to school. I /know/ I have to get out of bed to go to lecture and lab, but some days, I just don't, and I feel guilty every time I have to email a professor or TA about my absence or turning in late work because my brain is like ""you don't deserve to do this! you were just lazy!"" when logically I know it's because of my mental illness. You know what else sucks? No matter how much sleep I get, I'll still feel tired, whether its the meds or the illness--I'll never know lmfao.

People say ""get involved in clubs"" or ""volunteer in something you like"" or ""just try online dating"". Now to say I'm not involved in college would be a flat out lie as I'm in so many different orgs, extracurricular activities/ interest groups that everyone is always astonished by how much I do. Lol I even volunteer both on campus and in the SD community! Online dating has also been a nightmare and pretty unfruitful as well for people wanting actual relationships. I just feel that's it's pathetic that someone who has so many interests and would be such a solid partner is going to be forever single. What's wrong with me? Am I just unattractive? I don't think so because I've been asked out before-they were just with incompatible people.  Are my standards just too high?

As a graduating senior I have accumulated some minor wisdom from my 4 years of taking finals. I would like to impart said wisdom on all of you since there seems to be a bunch of inexperienced noobies. 
1) When coming into a classroom for an exam, try to fill the inner most seats FIRST so that the people coming in late don't have to stomp all over your feet or slap your face with their butt cheeks trying to get into that last open seat in the middle of a 20 seat aisle.  Also, if you have a huge backpack, tuck it UNDER YOUR SEAT so that when people finish their exam they don't have to hop over 10 backpacks just to get out of the aisle to turn in their exam. 
2) While taking a final or any exam, but especially a final, PLEASE DON'T CHEW GUM. If I had a dollar for every time I wanted to smack someone upside the head from their cow-level mastication,  I would have enough money to pay off one of my 20 student loans by now. DON'T DO IT.
3) Some more exam-taking etiquette: don't crack your knuckles every 2 minutes, it's gross and really distracting.  Don't tap your feet or pencil, it is also annoying and distracting.
4) LADIES (or guys too) if you have long, poofy hair that needs to take up 2-3 seats worth of space then WEAR IT UP IN A BUN OR BRAID OR SOMETHING TO KEEP IT OUT OF MY FACE WHILE I'M TRYING TO TAKE AN EXAM. I had my last final today and the deluded girl sitting next to me committed all of these offenses: she was chewing gum, she had a huge backpack that was blocking the aisle because she didn't put it under her seat, and her damn repunzel hair kept smacking me in the face every time she would turn the page on her exam. And what am I supposed to do? Get up and sit somewhere else in the middle of our final when all of the seats are taken? I'm not going to say anything to her because then it will look like I'm cheating. Just don't do it fam, please just tame the mane.

Hello there, I was wondering how I would ever talk to you but I guess I am here now, wishing for a miracle to happen. You have short hair that is just long enough to land its tips on your shoulder, beautiful smiles that seems so bright and charming to bring the sun to the dreading winter quarter, and incredible eyes that I sort of freeze when I ever looked at them. You sit in the middle of the lecture room towards the right side, and if I had to take a guess you always sit with your group of friends on the second row. If this is you, miracle has happened, I cannot ask for anything better. 

here is a little about me:

I sit in the third row on the left side of the middle section, often asking some of the dumbest questions. I also don't really pay attention to the class, and don't worry, I am not busy looking at you and being a creep, I am just bored since I am taking the class for my DEI requirement. 

What I'm trying to say is that I would like to get to know you. I don't know your name and I just see you at lecture. But I simply don't think I can talk to you, I don't want to come off as a creep. But I am a pretty outgoing person, its just that past experiences make me anxious when it comes to talking to girls. and what the hell, the quarter is over and I am probably never going to see you again. so here is my shot, and maybe I'll even talk to you after the final.

Here's my honest opinion of you: You teach incredibly well: I actually understand everything from CSE 20 because of your lectures. You are super funny: I really like your jokes. Your tests are not that hard: I was just sleepy and not focused. You teach class too early and do not cover the homework material sufficiently in class.

Overall bach, I am sorry for using such profane words to describe you. I hope you did not take it personally, for I was just a sad CS student failing your class.

I'm in my third year but I've never told this to anyone because it's awkward and potentially illegal. Within an hour of moving to UCSD at the beginning of freshmen year, I lost my virginity. It was all planned. My then boyfriend travelled from Arizona and booked a hotel room for a few days. We had an amazing time as we finally got to spend entire days together after three years of purely online interactions. But I was 17 and he was 19, so I couldn't tell anyone because I didn't want him to get into legal trouble. We're still together, but we've been engaged for over a year now and we get to see each other way more often. We don't have sex very often but it's not nearly as awkward as it was that first time. I am very grateful for him, and although he might not have his life together (and I might be a morosexual), he's the world to me. I wouldn't change this for anything.",,,

i'm part southeast asian, part other asian that I won't mention because that would probably easily identify me to my friends, a fourth year STEM major guy, and pretty sure i'm trans and want to be a girl. i've never felt complacent being manly or a guy. for the last year and a half, and especially the last few months my dysphoria acts up a lot. 

last summer one of my friends took me shopping since I told her I really wanted to try on a dress. when i tried it on and took pictures, I felt super happy. it was one of my best days of my life. i look at the pictures occasionally to make myself feel a little better if i'm feeling particularly dysphoric. in addition i'm hanging out with a few girls this week for a study session, and in the group chat the one girl i've told i'm trans to (jokingly) to the others said that I was a part of the girl's club. i smile a little bit whenever I look at that message, because I knew she knew and wanted to make me happy.

it's still hard though. trans asian-american females, and southeast asian ones at that (and STEM!) are a very small minority and I feel lonely most of the time. i've told a few friends, and they've been super nice to me about it, but i never know where to go. i'm not really out yet, and i've tried taking so many trips to the mall by myself to go buy a dress or skirt but stop in front of the store and fail because i'm scared. I also don't really vibe much with the other people at the lgbt center sadly. reddit as a space isn't much better. most if not all pictures of trans individuals there are white, so where I do I fit in?  

the worst part is that i always think that this part of me, this desire to be someone that I cannot, is wrong and shouldn't be. I don't like that to be who I want to look like and feel i might have to physically through hormones modify my body or go through years of voice feminization practice. 
why couldn't I have been just born a girl?
if i tried telling my parents this, i'm afraid of the family cutoff. I'm bi as well, but it feels much scarier trying to tell an asian family as a boy you want to be a girl rather than telling them you like other boys. 
I also really like my extended family from the two asian cultures I come from. i'm lucky enough I get to visit them in the two home countries a lot, but i'm scared of blowback, because losing the chance to connect with them feels like losing a part of myself. and when i'm already struggling with my gender identity, why not let the cultural one be lost along the way? 
i'm basically avoiding studying for finals, as you can tell. i'll probably try one day this week to go to the mall and see if I can work up the courage to buy a skirt or something. i love gender dysphoria <3

10385,2019-03-17 21:36:03,"While reading another confession and looking up what a sock on the doorknob meant, I ran into this gem. #CSE120

'A solution to a real life synchronization problem. The doorknob/sock combo is essentially an unenforced mutex object. If a roommate thread violates the mutex, either (linux dorms) the locking thread receives a SIG_COITUS interruptus or (Win98 dorms) the system crashes with an orgy sharing violation (thx m_turner!).

In practice: Both roommates want some private time in the room, but neither must enter while the other one is busy. When one roommate wants exclusive access to the room, they place a sock on the doorknob. Both are instructed not to enter the room if they see a sock in the door, and to wait until later. The sexiled roommate can check the doorknob at regular intervals or perhaps use exponential backoff timing between checks.
In code (for each roommate thread):

while(testAndSet(sockOnKnob)) {
    enterRoom();
    privateFunction();
    leaveRoom();
    removeSock();
}

This is an example of a spinlock using an atomic (uninterruptable) testAndSet() function. It assumes that both roommates are not in the room at the time the algorithm begins. Spinlocks in general are inefficient since the waiting roommate(s) are not doing anything productive while waiting. In a semaphore system, for example, the roommates would have pagers that would allow them to communicate via interrupts.'",,funnycs,

3 years ago, my ex broke up with me (i didn't want to). About a month after, one of his friends who I used to like before dating my ex started casually flirting with me, and kinda trying to get my ex completely out of my head i flirted back, although this lasted like a week at most. I knew the guy and my ex got along well, but had no idea to what extent their friendship went, and from what I still know he's just the kind of ""friend"" who's more than an acquaintance but less than a best friend or actual friend. To put this into perspective, they never engage in a conversation unless they're in the same place, where they friendly greet each other and start talking non stop (this is as much as I know about them). Anyways, he left for college and 4 months later came back and asked me out. At this point, my ex and I weren't talking, I asked for no contact when we broke up and I really wasn't interested in having a friendship with him, only being in ""friendly terms"" but we agreed I would message him whenever I wanted this to happen. So I went out with this guy, and ended up sleeping with him. He was my first and not my ex, because I didn't feel ready with my body while I was with my ex but I felt comfortable one year later and wanted to try. We started a fwb type of thing, although I later found out myself he was kind of my rebound to try and stop loving my ex. Stuff happened between this guy and I, and we stopped talking. Somewhere between this, I messaged my ex back because I felt I had ""already forgotten about him"" and was ready to just be on friendly terms. This was roughly 6 months after the breakup. Fast forward 6 more months, and after not seeing him for a year we met up (he wanted to know how I was doing) and I realized i still cared for him. Fast forward 4 more months and I travelled to the US from my home country, he came to visit me for a weekend, so did i, and we hooked up. This is when I knew I still had lingering feelings for him. Fast forward 6 months and he invites me to stay over at his apt. We hook up again, we cuddle and this is when I realized I actually still love him. We're still hooking up, and we've both confessed we still have feelings for each other. It took me this long to realize I want him back, and he's the reason I am never satisfied with any guys I try to date. However, the more I realized he DID matter to me, the worse I felt about sleeping with someone he knew. I want him back, i love him and only him but I can't bear to make a move feeling this guilty, and I don't know why if 1) we were broken up, 2) i didn't know and still don't know if their friendship goes beyond a friendly exchange of words at certain meetings once a year plus didn't care since I wasn't talking to my ex and 3)  i didn't even want to get back with him at that point, in fact I wanted him out of my life as much as I possibly could, so I couldn't love him ever again.

He did anything for me literally anything and loved me unconditionally.

When I got here my first week I cheated. I know. Don‚Äôt give me the well it‚Äôs your fault I know it is. Back then my mentality was i Want to experience some college fun. It lasted more than just one time, me and this boy started to have a little fling every now and then meanwhile I was telling my boyfriend i loved him. I hate myself so much for it. Just two days ago he found out and it broke both of our hearts. I tried my hardest to fight for our relationship and to my surprise, he took me back. I couldn‚Äôt believe it. I‚Äôm enternally grateful for it but I know his heart is shattered. It breaks my heart that I broke his. This makes me never want to go ‚Äò experience college ‚Äò I just want to be with him forever. I want him to treatment like he did but he can‚Äôt even kiss me he says because he imagines me doing it to the guy. I just wanna move past it and be all in love again. The thing is I don‚Äôt know if we‚Äôll ever been the same and that scares me to death. If things aren‚Äôt the same why be together. Idk. Just venting, don‚Äôt expect comments. I can‚Äôt even tell my friends because it‚Äôll make me look bad. He turned off his location, doesn‚Äôt tell me where he goes anymore he tries his hardest to ignore me but eventually gives in. I don‚Äôt blame him I don‚Äôt even deserve it.Today he came over to my house and that was nice. Just happened 2 days ago too. I lied about what I told him too. I told him we didn‚Äôt have sex but we did, probably 4-5 times. He has a gut feeling I did too but I can‚Äôt tell him that or he will really leave. I also can‚Äôt tell him that the first time we had sex the guy came inside of me, something I didn‚Äôt expect him to do at all and I was scared to death and we went to buy plan b together. I can‚Äôt ever tell my bf this he would really hate me. I just told him we kissed 3 times. Even with that he‚Äôs broken I can‚Äôt imagine him knowing everything and I still feel so shitty and guilty. And like I said, don‚Äôt make me feel worse, don‚Äôt tell me that. I should tell him because I‚Äôm not. I just really hope and pray we can go back to normal. We were the IT couple, he did everything for me, candle lit dinners, rose petal beds, huge prom poster asking infront of the whole school, love letters, everything.

Long story short, we get into a huge fight and break up, hurtful things said on both sides and her saying that she is only a lesbian now to further shut me out.

10463,2019-03-16 00:29:30,"buttholes are superior to vaginas.

buttholes have a much tighter grip.

they smell so much nicer (like seriously some of yall vag's smell so bad it made my dick die )

you don't get pregnant fucking in the butthole

they are so much more beautiful than vaginas. not to mention they are part of the ass, which is the best physical feature of a woman which makes it that much more beautiful.

i just don't wanna believe god is real if he would make fucking in the butt painful. if i was god, i would design buttholes to be easily and enjoyably fuckable for both parties. in fact that would be a great engineering feature on a human being. recreational sex in the butt and reproductive sex in the front. 

and on that same note, that's not fair that there's no way for women to understand the joy of having anal sex. women should have some kind of limb down there too that can penetrate a butthole so they can understand how much more beautiful buttholes really are. and no, straps on are not the same because your clit isn't being blessed by the touch of the inside of anal walls. and i sincerely wish there was a way for you to understand why there isn't anything that feels better than anal walls chocking on your dick.

i love buttholes. and i love women who are so devoted they are willing to let us fuck in the butthole and my only wish is that one day, there's a way i can reciprocate the favor in a way so that you can also appreciate the beauty of buttholes.

It was an amazing coincidence that we had multiple classes together, and I couldn‚Äôt believe she thought I was tolerable enough to study with.

We spent hours together this quarter studying, but it was really just that. There were quite a few moments where we shared some laughs and talked about deeper stuff, but mostly it‚Äôs been focused on completing our work. She‚Äôs an engineering student, like me. We‚Äôre both busy with school and work and research and she has probably 2 million friends because when you are that beautiful and cool, nobody can get enough of her and everybody wants to be around her. I, on the other hand, lack the genetic and social traits to make me popular among the typical college crowd. I‚Äôm a work horse, and I‚Äôve accomplished a great deal in terms of research and academics. But it hasn‚Äôt been without sacrifice, and it‚Äôs made me a sad and lonely man. 

And she just drives me CRAZY. She has a wickedly sharp mind and is drop dead gorgeous, so how could I not be swept away? I feel we work so well together and so does she, as she‚Äôs said on a few occasions. She‚Äôs been the most reliable partner I‚Äôve had and I just feel my heart thunder when I‚Äôm around her.

 I‚Äôm happy with where we are now, so I don‚Äôt want to jeopardize anything by telling her how I really feel about her. I‚Äôm trying to be as kind and thoughtful as possible around her, bringing her treats,  sending her cute dog vids when she‚Äôs feeling down, and trying to give her sincere and creative compliments.

I just hope that if we spend enough time together she‚Äôll eventully catch some feelings, because we could honestly be the most kick-ass power couple. She sometimes send me signs that I would perceive as being potential romantic interest, but I just feel she‚Äôs so busy and has so many options she would never pick a gremlin like me :( .

10143,2019-03-14 05:30:20,"I've been told that I should write down my thoughts and what goes on in my mind instead of going to therapy. I am only writing this to see other people's thoughts of what is going on in my head. Please don't write things like ""hmu OP."" I'm not here to try to make myself feel better or something. I don't know. If I seem like a kid that doesn't appreciate what he has, I am sorry. I try to be as grateful as I can, especially to my family. They try to give me a better future in their own way. This was just what I wrote in an hour when left to myself for an hour.

Some backstory. I'm just your average kiddo trying his best. My dad left to America when I was six to work and  I lived with my mom my entire until I came to live with my Dad for high school. I have always been told to do my work now and good things will eventually come. I'm still waiting for them to come. I have been suicidal for too many years that I can't count anymore. Or maybe not. Is it normal to think about killing yourself? I've only ever seriously tried to commit suicide three times and that was when I was much younger. The other times I pussyed out. I don't think I'll commit suicide anymore either. I've spent most my life saying, I've already toughed this much out, might as well wait for good times. Anyways, the rest of this is kind of long and just my thoughts. I tried to paragraph them the best I could, I hopped between topics that were on my mind so if it is hard to read, I'm sorry.

Your life is a joke. Your family are basically robots and they don't care about shit other than success. Asian culture is possibly the worst possible methodology of raising a child. Raising a kid and allowing him to pursue his passion is what is always preached but never used. I've actually had my parents straight up say they don't care what my passion is. It's like I'm not living my own life. I'm just walking down a pre-laid path, stumbling around until I die. I wonder what the suicide rates among asians are compared to the rest of the population. Is it really a tragedy when a student commits suicide? Is it really uncommon? There was already a student that committed suicide this fall quarter, but nobody addresses it. They just brush it under the rug and pretend like it has never happened. I didn‚Äôt even know until now. What kind of system does that? Is it a fault in our system that causes that? If i were to commit suicide, I feel as if I was determined, It would already be too late. I‚Äôm a stubborn guy haha. If i was like ‚ÄúThis is it and i will commit suicide‚Äù I would always be curious what kind of people are truly kind and true to themselves. As much as I criticize on my family for only being there for face value and never really showing others how they really feel, I honestly do the same. I feel as though I might be a sociopath or psychopath in that sense. I wonder if all my family is like that.

They never really show their emotions and they just do whatever it takes to better their own state. They don‚Äôt take into account other people and they will easily throw someone to the curb in order to better themselves. I feel as though they only do charity or seem kind so that they can front or tell themselves that they are genuinely good people. I do that too. I‚Äôm not a saint. I‚Äôm a major hypocrite. All my life I‚Äôve been wondering if I am a good person. Do good people really doubt whether they‚Äôre even nice? They just do it unconditionally. If I have to think ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to be a good person‚Äù, I can‚Äôt be a genuinely good person. I'm proud to say unlike my family that I feel sympathy though. I hold so much sympathy and patience for so many people. Except my family. I don't know why, but my patience runs thin with them and I get frustrated so easily by them now. Maybe its because my family is the only people who I get to see behind the curtains. I see them when they pretend to be nice. Laugh at other peoples jokes and then turn around and scoff at how they‚Äôre stupid. They‚Äôre lack of sympathy and empathy, projecting their anger on anyone even if they have nothing to do with anything.

I remember specifically this one time, my family was traveling and we took a taxi to a hotel that took a longer route just to make money. I understand it is scummy and hey they shouldn't have done that and taken advantage of us.I would be mad too. But since the taxi already left there wasn‚Äôt much we could do. Then my father went into the hotel and berated the woman who was working the front desk for what the taxi service has done. Why? That person had nothing to do with what they did. Why would you get worked up and mad at her specifically? They can‚Äôt do anything about it. I tried to calm him down and tell him to relax. What would yelling at them do. They aren't even responsible for what happened. And then he pushed me to the side and yelled at me. He said ‚ÄúTHIS DOES NOT INVOLVE YOU.‚Äù After he was done yelling at the clerk, he came over to me and said ‚ÄúSee? This is why you can‚Äôt let them take advantage of you. Never just get stepped on and always stand up for yourself.‚Äù Did you really think that was a valuable lesson? A teaching moment? All it let me know is that I can't believe in my family. They can't be my role models. They honestly aren‚Äôt anything like me. The dad that I have memories of, the one that I remember that had so much happiness and saw the world with so much love and care and sympathy, was very different then the real one I have. I guess it‚Äôs just the memory of a kid that's 6 years old that romanticize everything and sees people as perfect. But i don‚Äôt know. When I was younger I still knew my dad had anger issues. But it was Ok. Because he was still a  good person at heart right? 

My mom is a different story. I‚Äôm not sure what fond memory I have with her. All I remember is being forced to do things I didn't want. All I remember is getting beaten all the time. The memory that comes to me most is when I was in the corner and she punched me in the face and I fell on the ground. The memory is so muddled now and I can‚Äôt remember why she did it anymore. All I remember was the shock, pain, and sadness. Most of what is messed up with me I feel like is sourced from my mom. I actually think I might have been traumatized haha. My mom and my brother used my fear of the dark against me to make me do what they wanted. All I wanted to do was play with my friends and I understand that work needs to be done but I only got to work when I was younger. All those times locked in the garage and the basement. I still remember the fear and the hours I spent crying. I remember one time when I wanted to run away from home, and actually got the courage to do it. I left. And ran. Crying the entire time. Of course I couldn't even outrun my sister. She convinced me to come back. Her kindness is the only thing in my family. And when I came back the look on my moms face. Devoid of any sympathy. Just straight anger. Hilarious.

I'm not sure. Maybe I'm just lonely. I've tried to fill my life with things that might make me feel better. I've taken drugs before. I've surrounded myself with friends. But whenever I'm alone I always think like this. Nothing really gets better. Loneliness can't really be solved by anything.

Even though I do have feelings, I fear I may be a psychopath. Or maybe my control issues (which I am aware of) that originate as a consequence of a dramatically unstable childhood extend to my own emotional awareness and expression.

We developed a strong friendship at the age of 15, got together at 16, had our first kiss at 17 and lost our virginities to one another at 20. He wasn‚Äôt the best-looking guy and he was far from an ‚Äúalpha male‚Äù but he treated me like I was gold every single day of our relationship. I can honestly say that he had never hurt me. We had a great connection and had every intention to spend the rest of our lives together.

...Until I started wondering what else was out there. I looked around campus and saw other girls with these great-looking jock-types. I listened to stories of my friend as she hopped from the beds of player to player, making it sound as exciting as possible. Hook-up culture was rampant and hot guys were like trophies. When I saw girls at or below my smv pull alpha jock types, I started to stupidly wonder if I was ‚Äúselling myself short‚Äù. I‚Äôm ashamed to say that I actually began looking down on my poor boyfriend.

I broke up with him at 21, on summer break, simply stating that I felt like we had grown apart. Then fall quarter It didn‚Äôt take long for me to be approached by the most typical ‚Äúalpha‚Äù player jock that had ever lived. It‚Äôs actually hilarious how typical he was. Being hungry for what I felt like I‚Äôd been ‚Äúmissing out on‚Äù, I took him up on his offer and we became fwb. I knew it wouldn‚Äôt last- I‚Äôd heard all the stories and seen all the examples. But I decided that the experience was worth the potential outcome.

The potential outcome indeed happened. I found myself getting attached to him. Deeply. Just like the cliche goes, he didn‚Äôt feel the same (although he sure claimed to in order to keep me as a lay). He had an abundance of options, way too many to fall for lil‚Äô old me. I fell deeper and deeper as time went on to the point where I found it damn near impossible to let him go. I got badly hurt and embarrassed time and time again but whenever I tried to leave, he would pull me back, likely for the ego boost. It took him leaving the country for me to ‚Äúlet him go‚Äù.

Now,because of this fiasco, I feel dead inside. I can‚Äôt stand knowing that I left such a wonderful relationship for such a dumb reason. The most messed up part? My ex boyfriend told me that he still loved me and he forgave me for what I did. He was even open to getting back together. I couldn‚Äôt. I could no longer feel any kind of attraction to him anymore. In fact, I couldn‚Äôt feel it for anyone. Instead of having an n count of 1 (my potential husband), I now have a raised one. I can only see loneliness in my future; marriage is a far-fetched fantasy. This, I brought entirely on myself.

Let me tell you a guy whether shy or not WILL always go out of their way to get your number/talk to you if they are INTERESTED in you. Attractive women get approached all the time by all sorts of guys.I've seen a lot of shy/quiet guys approach my friends and ask them out.Guys would rather spend all their money on a pretty girl just to impress her.

tldr; asked a question i wasnt ready to hear the answer to yet owo

So my boyfriend is coming home this wknd for his spring break, and since it's long-distance, we call every night. During my call tonight, he makes a joke about feet and I teasingly ask him if there are any other kinks he should warn me about. While I was the one to bring it up, I didn't really think it through, I just meant like other weird things that he's into, but now after talking I realize that.. . yeah kinks are sexually explicit. We hadn't brought any of this other stuff up before and I was just so shook,, this man was so straightforward with me (which I appreciate bc we love each other but nonetheless shook). Here I am planning to cuddle up with him, considering that I've literally only kissed him on the cheek, and he's waiting to see my thoughts on x-y-z. While yeah I would maybe want to try certain things and am willing to keep an open mind, I really want to keep it above the waist for the sake of the relationship,, bUt he's a spicy kind of guy. And so while he says he's fine with not doing certain things, I can't help but wonder if the passion will decrease on his end because there's other things that he's experienced and enjoys. I want to please my man ofc and I know he's understanding, but I want to stay strong with what I believe. Making a decision that isn't aligned with your values can suck afterward, so I'm trying to think it through in case I'm breathless and can't articulate my feelings. ",,nsfw,

I would barely talk to people and I was the quiet girl who sat with a group of people who didn‚Äôt care enough to invite me to things. The very few decent friends I did have were sort of the outcasts in high school, which meant that I probably was too. I was sort of involved, but I wasn‚Äôt very good at what I did. Around senior year I felt like I was finally becoming more outgoing which helped. Anyway fast forward to college and I decided to do sorority recruitment. Now that I was in college, I felt like I could be my 100% self. I ended up in a well-respected sorority. Most of my sisters were clearly popular in high school, and the guys we hang out with in other frats looked like they were popular too. I feel like I still am still sort of obviously awkward and I feel like they would judge me if they knew what I was like in high school. And I feel like people in high school are probably shocked and confused now that I‚Äôm in a good sorority, and would even think I am living a lie. I know this probably sounds so stupid, but it‚Äôs something that‚Äôs been bothering me. I think I rushed to validate myself which makes me ashamed. I do really like the sorority I am in because the girls are genuine and chill, but I think if I was the same person I was in high school when I rushed, they would‚Äôve not invited me back. ",,,

I'm finally ready to try out some relationship stuff again, but I feel like I need to learn to put myself out there again (or more honestly for the first time) to get anywhere.

How do I make friends this late into the year? ""

unposted,2019-02-19 15:48:48,"I've seen a lot of posts on here of guys that aren't able to attract the women they want. I relate with that 100%. It doesn't have to stay that way though. You may or may not have heard of this, but there is a company called Real Social Dynamics that teaches guys how to attract girls. If you're open minded enough, take control of your dating life and check it out. Search RSD on YouTube.

And if you think that's ""weird"" or something, just take baby steps and talk to 1 new girl a day. Notice how they react to your actions. Make adjustments every day. You'd be surprised how much control you actually have over this area of your life.

Contact me if you want more info or help with this :)",[redacted],,
