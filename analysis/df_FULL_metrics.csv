I do have other resources like asking other grad students in my lab or googling/looking at Youtube videos on certain topics. I definitely use the Internet often to learn more about something, but I feel that it's not enough. I do talk to the other graduate students, but since they're not specifically mentoring me, I feel a little limited.

I might be in love with someone, or almost in love at any rate. I think it might also just be a hunger to have someone that I could love and be loved by. It‚Äôs an ache, but also almost comforting. I got a little taste of what it could have been if things had gone differently, and that certainly intensified things. And I know I could still maybe take that path, but it wouldn‚Äôt be right. You can‚Äôt make other people love you when you know that you can‚Äôt give them what they really need. I‚Äôm a fucking mess, after all. Closeted, tired, anxious, ill, afraid.  

Additionally, I don‚Äôt want to be a consolation prize, and deep down, with that particular person, it would always be that way in my own eyes. Essentially, I‚Äôm only a placeholder, a poor substitute, a seemingly nearby convenience‚Äì even though being in their arms felt so right, it would be so very wrong because I wouldn‚Äôt be what she really wants in the first place. She once said a long time ago that she had thought she liked me, but then realized it was just proximity. If they had wanted me, it would have happened by now. Besides, I don‚Äôt want to stick around my hometown. I need to move on and out, or else I‚Äôll just suffocate willingly in my own dead air.  

And yet if she ever calls, I‚Äôm there. I know I would do anything in my power for her. I am loyal to those I care about, basically to a fault. For someone who wants to escape life, I almost always stick around. 

Then again, I‚Äôm human. And that means wanting disparate and entirely non-simultaneous things, the existence of the cake in conjunction with its absence. I love her. But I also don‚Äôt. I want her to love me back, but I also want nothing to do with that aspect of our relationship whatsoever. I want to stay close by, but I also want to be as far away as possible from the life I have lived for the past twenty years. I don‚Äôt want to be me anymore, whatever that means. I don‚Äôt want to be the person she knows anymore, and I will never probably be the person she thinks I am, although she‚Äôs probably closer to the truth than anyone else is. 

It is reminiscent of how I feel when I want to kill myself. I want to die, to escape, to be free, to feel nothing ever again, to feel everything at once and then let it go. I also want to live‚Äì so I can escape, and feel positive things, and be free, free, free and actually enjoy living my life. Hard to enjoy freedom when dead. It‚Äôs also hard to find love and love someone while simultaneously disavowing those emotions.  

She kind of admitted to loving me, but not exactly. She referenced queerplatonic love, a relationship that goes beyond friendship but is not romantic. I kind of admitted the same thing, but then I pretended to misunderstand‚Äì to think it just meant friendship when I know it doesn‚Äôt. But I couldn‚Äôt admit how real it is to me, and how much further I have fallen than she realizes when I know that isn‚Äôt what she wants. We agreed that we were better as friends. I honestly believe that, but I wish I didn‚Äôt. I don‚Äôt want to believe that‚Äì and I can‚Äôt fully believe it either. Disparity strikes again.  

I think she might feel something for me, perhaps more than she did in the past. She keeps me close enough, or at least the memories of me now that I have moved away. I‚Äôm the only person whose photograph is by her bedside. Her touches linger a bit more than they used to, especially after that particular conversation on what we have, what we are, what we might have been. But I‚Äôm going to close my eyes and ignore what I see, and I know she will do the same. We‚Äôre far too similar, after all.

I miss him alot. Or I thought I did. Recently, I found an old picture of him and it didn‚Äôt hurt as much as I thought it would. What hurt more was knowing that someone could be that close to you, that important to you and then it suddenly means nothing. 

Mostly, I‚Äôm angry at myself for not being honest that I should have gotten mental health help first. I‚Äôm angry that I wasn‚Äôt honest with him or the person I knew I was at the time.

at the end of the flight, he tried saying goodbye to me, but if you‚Äôve ever been on a flight, you‚Äôd know it‚Äôs really hectic getting off; so i was going to properly say bye to him when we got to the gate outside. i think i made him feel awkward by not really responding to him at the end of the flight so when i slowed down to talk to him, he walked really fast and ended up leaving before i could say anything. i tried to chase him down and maybe exchange contact info, but he never heard me.

    My family life has been rough. My mom was severely abused by both of her parents, and until this day, my grandma manages to emotionally abuse my mom the 1-2 times she sees her every year (she lives abroad). My mom and dad are both individually good people, but are awful together. My dad controls my mom, cheated on her, and bad mouthed her. My mom has emotionally abused him. My mom has also severely emotionally and mentally abused me growing up, and continues to do so sometimes until this day. She also shows obvious favoritism to my little sister. The details of that would be another post, but let‚Äôs just say she sees herself in my sister, thus tries to live through her, giving my sister a more loving upbringing, while I was always shut down and villianized. Although my dad is a bad husband, he‚Äôs only been a good father to my siblings and me.
    I‚Äôve also been sexually assaulted 3 times...well, by 3 different people. My ex sexually abused me various times.

This is part of why I am conflicted about having feelings for them and am afraid of being more upfront, even with graduation on the way. I don‚Äôt get the sense that it would be a huge surprise to them, it‚Äôs just that I am not one to make moves and shyness is one of my defining outward traits.

I got into a long distance relationship with a guy just before I started school here. I broke up with him because of the lack of communication between us and lies..? I've been feeling really depressed about this, so I'm going to write out my thoughts. I guess, I just need to relieve myself of my doubts or just need reassurance.. Idk. 

Our relationship was good from mid Aug to end of Sept. Things got shady (from his side), we would argue about small matters like calling and video calling (he didn't want to), he would only text me once a month in October & November, then in December he came online twice (this was when I broke it off with him; fyi, I would've broken up with him earlier, but he would only text me/come online during his afternoon, which was past my midnight). His reason, as to why he barely had time to text/call his girlfriend (me) was because his dad was in the hospital after having a heart attack and needed to stay because he had some heart issues, then in December he texted me that his dad died, his sister was suicidal, and he's a mess and has been missing uni. Then the following two weeks, he came online again (in December), I broke up with him.. Afterwards, he would be online a ton, he found his comfort talking to my friends. I missed him, so I asked him to come back.. but then my doubts bothered me even more. So, I broke up with him on January 13th and went offline social media until I felt okay. 

Because he would decline to call/video call me so much, I ended up having doubts about him and thinking about what if's, more than actually studying. That quarter, I resulted with a C and 2 F's. While being in a relationship with him, I felt lonely, sad, and tired of everything. I started to binge eat and gave up on working out (because in my head, I thought what if he texts me and I'm busy.. I need to talk to him when he's online), so I basically gave up my reality waiting for him you can say. (Wow, my life actually sounds so sad while writing this out). After we broke up (in Jan.), I went offline and came back when I was okay. But just recently, tbh it's been almost a whole week since I've been feeling depressed, missing him. 

It's normal to just be like, whatever he was stupid. He was probably a catfish. But the issue is the first guy I dated was emotionally abusive and manipulative. So 3 years later when this new guy came into my life, even when we had arguments he would end it by saying ""I love you, ok?"" And I would reply, ""I love you too"". There wasn't a time where he made me feel small or weak and he never cursed me out. He treated me like how a good bf is suppose to treat their gf... ig? 

I forgot to mention.. (I'm going to get so much hate for this and will surely be called stupid.. ik ik I was stupid) He only ever sent me one photo of himself, and it's blurry [If you want to see it, ask admin]

What I'm torn over is should I contact maintenance?

In the same episode Stan and his girlfriend Wendy broke up, so Stan joined the emo/goth group and then the conversation goes like this
Goth kid: We're gonna go to the graveyard and write poems about death and how pointless life is. 
Butters: Uh, uhm no thanks. I love life.
Stan: Huh? But you just got dumped.
Butters: Well yeah, and I'm sad, but at the same time I'm really happy that something could make me feel that sad. It's like, it makes me feel alive, you know? It makes me feel human.

In short I was told that Person A has told a few people that Person B told them that I harassed them.  Let me first clarify that I didn‚Äôt.  

Starting with B, I think I suspect who it might be if A isn‚Äôt lying which I‚Äôll get to later.  But what horrifies me is that they‚Äôre not the type of person to do this?  Why do I suspect her then?  Because I‚Äôve actually communicated with her and therefore she‚Äôs probably the only person I could have potentially harassed.  But the thing is it‚Äôs not as if I try to talk to B a lot and can‚Äôt take any hints.  It‚Äôs more like I kinda talk to them from time to time then this shit comes out of nowhere and it could only have come from them.

Frankly, I don‚Äôt like to think B could do this assuming it is them.  That‚Äôs why I think it‚Äôs much more likely that A made this shit up.  This isn‚Äôt unlikely since A is quite a despicable person from what I‚Äôve seen.  Why would they do this?  As far as I know, B is a control freak and doesn‚Äôt want me interacting with their social circle so they told all of them I harassed A in order to exclude me.  It‚Äôs not a big deal since I wasn‚Äôt exactly friends with any of these people but it bothers me that B could say such things about me and that there are people who apparently believe them, since I‚Äôve been effectively excluded.

As for the social circle I guess they have no reason to believe me over A but it also bothers me that they don‚Äôt care to fact check either although maybe they had an B is the liar.

This isn‚Äôt like an official school club or anything so it‚Äôs not like I could report it to higher ups or anything.

14057,2019-05-18 16:17:11,"Hey guys. It‚Äôs story time (or venting time, rather)! I‚Äôm not asking for advice or input or anything like that in this post. I just wanted to vent and air some thoughts and feelings that have been on my mind for a fair while.

A couple of weeks ago, I decided to (more-or-less permanently) leave an org I was in, the first one I had ever joined.

Back in September, I made the decision to join this org over Intergenerational Connections because it fit into my schedule (anyone reading this who is in Intergenerational Connections, let me say that I look forward to being a part of your org fall of next year). I attended their informational session and was struck by how much the org‚Äôs work aligned with my personal interests. I was also struck by how everyone made me feel so welcome and at home. They were a very charismatic and warm-hearted bunch of people. I committed myself to the org and began to attend their meetings regularly.

Before we go further, allow me to make one clarification. While, the org did have a formal hierarchical structure with a club president and her vice-presidents and director generals and so on, it was de facto led  by two people (as in they did the visible day-to-day running of the org) whom I will henceforth refer to as ‚ÄòJ‚Äô and ‚ÄòS‚Äô (for ‚ÄòJunior‚Äô and ‚ÄòSenior‚Äô; they held the same position in the org‚Äôs leadership, but one was the senior partner and one was the less-experienced junior partner), along with their associates (all of whom are VERY close friends with one another). S was away on business across the country for fall quarter but returned in January. Hence, for all of fall quarter, J ran the show alongside the org‚Äôs de jure leadership.  

My first quarter in the org were my happiest times there. We were taught the basic functions of the org and got together for some socials. My relationship with the org‚Äôs leadership was also quite positive during this time. When I injured myself and wasn‚Äôt able to attend org meetings for a couple of weeks, I emailed J telling her what had happened and she responded by saying that she totally understood and that I‚Äôm welcome back whenever I recover. A couple of weeks later, she spontaneously emailed me again checking in on my progress and to see how I was recovering. I was truly touched by the care and sincerity she showed me. After my first meeting following my recovery, I explicitly told her in person that and expressed my appreciation to her. She stated that she and S worked hard over the previous year to make the org more inclusive and less ‚Äúelitist‚Äù by interacting more with all org members, new and old. At the end-of-year social we had a week or so later, she hugged me before I left and said to me ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so glad that you‚Äôre back with all of us‚Äù. I was, again, touched by her remarks. 

Then winter quarter came and that‚Äôs when things began to go pear-shaped. S returned from her business away from UCSD and she properly introduced herself to the lot of us at the first meeting of the quarter. Then J, a couple of other new org members, and I went away to attend a work function for a couple of days. During our time away, I felt that J was becoming increasingly tense and distant around me. When we returned, I asked her (through Messenger) if something was wrong (with the intent to repair any damage there may be between us). She replied with a very lengthy text that essentially accused me of disrespecting her leadership and S (for reasons unbeknownst to me; she didn‚Äôt attend the work function with us) as well as of being sexist, without providing a shred of justification for either claim. 

I was absolutely speechless. I had no clue what she was talking about. I always ALWAYS make sure to treat everybody, irrespective of sex, with respect and dignity. I always make sure to treat my superiors with the appropriate level of respect as well. I replayed the entire time we were at the work function and could not think of one instance where I had treated her with anything less than absolute respect. I asked people close to me, people who I know would not lie to me and would give me the honest truth, if I was sexist. The result was a resounding and unanimous ‚ÄòNo‚Äô.

Being accused point-blank of such terrible things infuriated me to no end. It hurt me deeply, and I felt as if I had been betrayed. I thought about asking her to justify why she felt the way she did and trying to see if we could work it out, but then concluded that any attempt to talk to someone who‚Äôd so easily accuse another person of such horrible things would bear no fruit and that I‚Äôd just be wasting my time by trying to reason with her. Should I have attempted to talk to her? In retrospect, perhaps, but in all honesty, I didn‚Äôt feel the need or desire to have to negotiate with someone like that, nor do I now. I, and a couple of my friends, came to the conclusion that her lashing out at me as she did was the manifestation of some massive insecurity she felt as a result of struggles in her personal life (that she had detailed to us at one of our socials) as well as that outing being the first outing where she‚Äôs led the team without the help of other org leaders or the guidance of S. 

From that day on, I‚Äôve spoken less than 15 words to J. I simply refuse to even talk to people with that kind of mentality. They‚Äôre not worth my time and energy.

My experience with the org only declined from there on out. I slowly came to the realization that I couldn‚Äôt commit nearly as much time to it as they would like me to commit and consequently, chose not to go on anymore work outings with them. My relationship with the org leadership also slowly dissipated. Socials stopped being as fun as they used to be. They mostly consisted of all the senior org people (J and S included) and their close friends who used to be in the org clumped together in one area and then all of the new people in another, shut out from the former group and forced to conserve amongst themselves. The synergy and commingling between old and new members that existed in the fall was well and truly dead. At this point, I understood that the elitism J said her and S had worked to dismantle hadn‚Äôt gone away at all. They had simply supplanted the old order with their new order. They became the very thing they swore to destroy. (Any nerds out there? ;)) 

I think I have made my case for my disappointment with J‚Äôs lack of leadership skills (or people skills for that matter) quite evident already. I had hoped that with S‚Äôs return, the org would become more united than ever before. She is, from what I could tell, a strong and determined and caring person. She told us at the first meeting after she returned that she cared for each and every one of us and that she looked forward to getting to know us better over the course of the year. Despite this promising beginning, however, her leadership left much to be desired. Indeed, the rest of the org‚Äôs leadership left much to be desired. They claim that they‚Äôre committed to unifying all of us and getting to know us as individuals, yet their actions don‚Äôt reflect those words. They, without fail, chose to not blend with the new members whenever the opportunity presented itself. They subconsciously excluded all of us from their circle and consequently established an elitist hierarchy of sorts within the org where there was a small privileged group at the top and everyone else at the bottom, and there is apparently no opportunity for upward mobility. No chance of fraternizing or building bonds with the senior members of our org.  

In essence, their hearts seemed to be in the right place, but their actions did not reflect their verbal commitments. They didn‚Äôt try, in my mind, anywhere near hard enough to reach out to us and get to know us. They could have and should have done better (even when taking into account their busy academic lives and their personal lives as well).

So, for these reasons, as well as for the reason of me not clicking with a majority of the people in the org old and new (which is perfectly fine and natural), I decided to leave the org. I would have left in early February if it wasn‚Äôt for personal reasons and commitments that obligated me to stay until early May. 

I suppose my departure is a bittersweet experience for me. Bitter because of all the resentment and disappointment that has stemmed from this experience. Sweet because I finally did leave, and at least now I know what it‚Äôs like to be in that org.

Are you guys going to seriously tell me that that's not a real issue? If you don't like how your SO looks or your SO doesn't like how you look then maybe that should be something that is considered. Of course there's a very very nice way to explain all of this but let's be mature about this and realize that sometimes people get comfortable in relationships or get really stressed. This might be lead to you or your SO being more overweight than you were while you were dating or before you got together and they might not find you as attractive as they used to. That's a thing that happens all the time and it leads to dead bedrooms so often. 

But some of the confessions that were posted sounded like their SOs were being rude. People need to realize that if/when you find your partner physically unattractive and especially if they find themselves unattractive too that's when you need to support them the most to do what they want/need to do to feel better physically and mentally. Things can always improve as long as people some work into it. Sometimes you just need to sit down and have a talk. I shouldn't have to say this but seeing the previously posted confessions idk. Be nice and be supportive. If you can't do those things, you need to work on yourself before you can be in the relationship you're in. 

If your partner however is comfortable with how they look and you're trying to impose your beauty standards on them then stop unless I guess they're physical health is at stake.

We would go out to eat multiple times a week and he would often pay for my food as well, which I thought was really nice of him. 
Somewhere in the middle of summer I started to develop feelings for him and I thought that he may like me as well. We would always watch shows in my bedroom and while doing that, we would lay on each other and shift around  on the bed a lot, always touching one another while we watched in some way. I never told him I was bi and to my knowledge he was straight. 
After I went back to school we kept in touch a lot, texting each other every so often for a time. Even now we still occasionally talk, but less often.
Im tempted to give him a call soon and see if we'll both be in town soon when I go home for part of the summer, but I'm worried that things might feel weird between us after so long (I don't still like him, mostly, but if it turns out that he's into guys I wouldn't say no to going out).

Anybody who has taken Chinese with Cha Laoshi knows how kind and gentle-hearted he is. When I took his class in 2018, he caught people cheating but let them off with a stern warning (for cheating on hw tho). Samuel Cha has a sterling reputation at UCSD, and he isn't one to accuse a student of cheating and report them to AIO without substantial reason/evidence. 

Also, Alvin's explanation of what happened in confessions 3.0 was super unclear and sounds like he's deliberately leaving incriminating information out. It's 2019, anybody can spoof a Google maps location (people did it all the time to cheat on Pokemon go). No professor just randomly decides to accuse you of cheating without evidence. Interesting how Alvin doesn't mention any of the evidence against him, and I'm sure he has no interest in doing so either. If you've ever taken a class with Samuel Cha, you would agree with me that something about Alvin's story doesn't add up. 

Don't get me wrong, it's totally possible that Alvin is innocent. But until he's willing to share with us ALL the facts of his case CLEARLY, y'all shouldn't donate a cent to his GoFundMe.

13922,2019-05-17 18:22:52,"I sense that a number of people in this group want to move the community away from Facebook out of (understandable) fears of this new page getting zucced again and/or out of the belief that the new confessions are bland and boring. I personally don‚Äôt see how these confessions are dull, nor do I know what the hell these people are looking for in these posts (whatever the fuck this ‚Äúspice‚Äù they talk about refers to). In fact, I think they‚Äôre as good as the old ones on 3.0 near its demise (if not better, since they‚Äôre now curated for quality). 

If we move away from Facebook, the whole community will suffer. There isn‚Äôt a shred of doubt in my mind about that. Most people aren‚Äôt going to go with the dedicated confessions webpage and then regularly check it for new posts. 

A big reason for this community‚Äôs success (as well as the original page which I wasn‚Äôt a part of and 3.0 along with similar ones at Berkeley and Irvine) is primarily because it is on Facebook. An ungodly number of people on this campus use Facebook to some extent or another, and thus, it is easy for us to keep up with the page and offer advice and insight and GIFs and whatnot in response to posts on it. It is also easy for new people to join and contribute, since they did not need to go to a separate website and make a new account to comment. It also makes the pages quite visible and easy to find, which also makes it easy for us to increase membership size. If this community wasn‚Äôt on Facebook, I probably would have never found out about it and my life would‚Äôve been less colorful as a result.

Moving away from Facebook simply inexplicable in my view. It is utterly irrational and indefensible. Simply put, it would be the end of this community as we know it if we abandon Facebook, and I promise you, nothing will ever be the same again.

I fuckin‚Äô love this page and this group of people and I love how we now have a space where we can vent and express ourselves and ask for/get help without shame or fear. It‚Äôs help me plenty (as well as allowed me to give aid and comfort to others in need), and I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs helped plenty of others too. I love all of the love and respect and camaraderie we have with one another. It‚Äôd be a real goddamn shame if it were to suddenly go away.

How about this? If you want ‚Äúspice‚Äù in the community so bad, how about we adopt the idea put forth by #13743. The admins can create a separate webpage (they said they were thinking about). But instead of shifting our operations unto that new page and just putting highlights from that page on the Facebook page, we keep Facebook as our main base of operations and simply put highlights and submissions that could potentially violate Facebook‚Äôs rules (which I assume are the ‚Äúspicy‚Äù confessions) on that page. In essence, have the separate confessions webpage serve as a complement to the main Facebook page and help it avoid getting zucced again. 

Also, implement the separate Google Form for complaints about posts and comments that are deemed offensive or inflammatory or in poor taste or whatever and then ADVERTISE THE SHIT out of that form to ensure that old members and new members alike know where to go when they want to report something. If Berkeley and Irvine can manage to keep their respective communities thriving with these structures and (I think) more draconian rules and restrictions than we have, why the fuck wouldn‚Äôt we be able to keep 4.0 afloat with these two measures?

13919,2019-05-17 17:40:21,"Hello team!

I‚Äôm the guy from #12948 back on 3.0 (yes, I record the numbers of all my posted confessions). In case you don‚Äôt remember who I am, I‚Äôm the guy who had a crush on a girl in my org for 5 months and then was informed by her that she had a boyfriend 45 seconds before I was gonna ask her out.

I‚Äôm back to share with all of you the conclusions I've drawn and, more importantly, pass onto you a piece of advice based on a realization I had after smoldering about this over the last two weeks. 

(Note: I actually wrote a response to another post that responded to the original confession, but it got posted about 40 minutes before 3.0 got zucced, so‚Ä¶ yeah, didn‚Äôt have much time to circulate. Besides, this post will be of much more value and greater quality... I hope)

First things first, I am touched by the outpour of support and sympathy I got on the original post on 3.0. I was absolutely not expecting all of you to be so interested and I am genuinely floored and grateful. Thank you all so very much.

So, after two weeks of mulling over what I could have done differently, I personally felt that I wasn‚Äôt dealt a very good hand of cards to start with. I fell for a lady who was a year ahead of myself and graduating in 2 quarters (whilst I still had 8 to go), who held a leadership position in the org I was in, and supremely busy (and thus really difficult to talk to). I couldn‚Äôt get over the fact that she was (in the context of the org) my superior and thus I stopped myself from proactively trying to get to know her better and getting closer to her. I couldn‚Äôt get over the personal belief of how it is supremely inappropriate to develop feelings of romance for your higher-ups and that you ought to maintain a courteous, professional, and somewhat distanced relationship with them (a product of my upbringing). 

The person who responded to my original confession on 3.0 stated that I didn‚Äôt really know her for who she was and that I just had a severe case of infatuation. Perhaps, but I like to think I was able to cobble together a rough sketch of who she truly was based on what she‚Äôs shared with us (the org) and what I‚Äôve heard from others and then made an informed decision to go after her based on that sketch. She was a very strong woman who knew what she wanted from life and refused to take shit from anyone else yet immensely caring and compassionate. She looked out for the well-being of everyone in our org (it‚Äôs fairly small) and knew its quirks like the back of her hand. She was immensely intelligent and a politics and military buff (specifically military strategy). In short, she possessed a number of admirable qualities and traits, qualities that I look for in a lady (and my God, was she a fine lady).

Thinking back, I realize that even if she had been single and I had been more assertive, we probably would‚Äôve ended up getting together sometime in late February or early March, and considering that she‚Äôs graduating in June, I probably would‚Äôve been dumped around this time. I don‚Äôt think 3 months or so is nearly enough time to build the necessary foundations for a lasting off-campus relationship. And while I believe in Lord Tennyson‚Äôs words, ‚ÄúTis better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all‚Äù, I think the devastation would have been far worse had this been the case. Also, I think it‚Äôs safe to assume that she‚Äôs probably been dating this person she‚Äôs with for a fair while (most likely even before she returned from her business across the country in January).

So, given the realities of the situation, there really wasn‚Äôt much I could do. In fact, I think I was shit out of luck from the get-go. 

The only way I could‚Äôve gotten with her, realistically, was if I joined the org with her last year, which is a preposterous hypothetical. A) As a newbie freshman, I wasn‚Äôt ready to immerse myself into clubs yet. B) I wasn‚Äôt even sure I was going to join that org until earlier this year; and that‚Äôs only because it fit into my schedule. And C) I mean, how could I have known at the time that if I joined that org, I‚Äôd meet and fall for a very lovely single lady with whom I shared similar interests?

And that‚Äôs when it dawned on me.

It is highly unlikely (statistically speaking) that she is the only person on this campus with whom I‚Äôd click and I‚Äôd share similar interests. What if there are other women out here at UCSD who are just like her, with whom I can bond? It‚Äôs just they‚Äôre scattered all over campus in different lecture halls and colleges and orgs and I haven‚Äôt had to opportunity to encounter them yet.

And that gives me hope for the future.

It tells me that odds are I‚Äôll probably bump into another lady just like her who‚Äôd make me feel all of these things again (and, God willing, be single), so I needn‚Äôt worry too much. I shouldn‚Äôt aggressively go around campus looking for a new crush. I should concentrate on myself and live life to the fullest and enjoy my time here at UCSD and focus on self-improvement, on becoming the best person I can be. 

That is what I‚Äôve learned from this experience, and that‚Äôs the advice I want to pass on to you.

You, the reader, the lovely single men and women of the Confessions Community who are frustrated with your lot in life. The most wonderful people enter your life when you least expect them. So get out there, talk to the people around you, join that org, go to that social or that trivia night, comment on that post on Confessions 4.0. Live life to the fullest, without regrets, and without looking back. You may end up finding the woman/man of your dreams as well as friends for life, as well as learn a whole plethora of new things about yourself and the world around you (I know I‚Äôve found at least one of those two things). I know all of this sounds cliche and cloyingly optimistic, but it‚Äôs absolutely true. I guarantee it.

It's better for the environment too (all packaging is compostable!). WHY CANT WE HAVE THIS TOO THO
I get that there are a few vegan things in the dining halls and markets, and we are lucky enough to have Roots on campus (which is always PACKED during lunch hours), but that's barely anything considering all the options for people who eat meat (remember, non-vegans still eat and enjoy vegan foods too!). There seems to be an increase in the vegan population as a whole, and many people are also trying to cut down on their consumption of animal products for a large variety of reasons, so it would make sense to provide more options.

Obviously the best answer is to talk to him again but I hate repeating myself more than once when it comes to expressing concerns and problems. I feel like he should take into consideration with how I feel cause I‚Äôm sure he wouldn‚Äôt like if I started to follow a bunch of men and half my feed is shirtless men with six packs and a ripped body.

13722,2019-05-15 23:47:40,"For the second time recently, a dude who I just met/do not know well has poured out all of their mental health concerns on me. In both cases, I recommended therapy, and in both cases, they said that there's nothing a therapist could tell them that they don't already know/didn't think of. One of them has essentially made me his therapist yet refuses to have an open mind about anything, and also can't share anything with his family/friends due to fear of judgement. 

I can't say that all men do this, or that only men do, but it really seems like a symptom of toxic masculinity. First of all, do you really think you've thought of EVERYTHING that someone who studied for years specifically to help people like you has? Why are you so against trying it out? Why can't you talk to your other guy friends instead of a random girl you met in lecture or at a party? Why do you think you're above getting help?

My hunch is that men are expected to be able to handle their emotions themselves, whereas women are seen as more emotional (and thus treatment is more acceptable). For guys, showing emotions, having mental health issues, or getting help would be a sign of weakness. 

Please take care of your mental health. Ask your guy friends how they're really doing. Support each other! And if you need to, be open to therapy, because it'll help. I can at the very least guarantee it'll help more than spilling your guts out to a stranger who did not ask to be your sole source of emotional support.

I've spent some years trying to improve my attitude towards women and respect them. But recently I did something messed up, and now it seems like all of my effort was a waste, and that no matter how much work I put in I still fall back to the same harmful thoughts.

I think this goes deeper than society conditioning me to think like this (if that's plausible or a thing), but my behavior towards women seems to be the most troubling atm. I really do want to talk with my female friends and family about this, but I'm scared as hell that they'll just disregard my feelings about all of this, just throw solutions without listening, or see me in a negative light.

But I'm not here to share my life story. I want to be better than this. I don't like harming the people around me, regardless if I care for them or not. For anyone who's also struggled with this, what things have you done to recover? Therapy seems nice, but it looks expensive (money's tight) and we all know CAPS has a waiting list for months.

Women don't seem to have much of a problem being my friend and keeping me around as long as its at a friendly distance. Any interest I show is just treated as unwanted and unsolicited attention.

And it bothers me because this is nothing new, and I've put so much effort into dressing nicer, getting fit, acting kinder, improving my speaking, getting some more hobbies and skills. But it seems like its all for nothing. Some of my friends say maybe i try to hard. But what am i supposed to do? In everything else in my life, there is a clear correlation between how much effort i put in and the results i get. But when it comes to romance if i put in no effort=shit results. If i put in effort=shit results. and now im just insecure, frustrated, and lonely.

All i really want to do is share my love. I'd really like to court a strong, intelligent woman and help her get what she wants from life. I've got a pretty good thing going on, but it really isnt that fun to do everything feeling so alone. It just feels selfish and hedonistic and I want to live for the benefit and prosperity of others. It'd be nice to think im worth something, and all i want to do is prove it to someone who i care about and who cares about me. 

Sometimes i arrive to the conclusion that I'm either a jerk or weapon-grade ugly.

1) Please actually tell us your complete order rather than having us interview you for the specs of what you want. For example, what size drink you want, what kind of bagel/donut you want, whether you want cream cheese with your bagel, whether or not you want whipped cream. We aren‚Äôt mind readers, and when there are 30 customers in line during a rush its really inconvenient for everyone if we have to spend time figuring out what you want if you just come up and order ‚Äúa london fog and a bagel.‚Äù

2) If you‚Äôre not paying with dining dollars and we ask if it‚Äôs going to be dining dollars, just say ‚Äúno‚Äù instead of saying yes and then pulling out your credit card bc then we have to cancel and change payment method, which is inconvenient especially during a rush. And if its not dining dollars, it would be helpful if you actually said what the payment is going to be instead of having us grill you with ‚Äúcard? Cash? Community?‚Äù

3) Take off your headphones/earbuds when you talk to us. Maybe then you‚Äôd actually hear what we are saying rather than just guessing. 

4) If you are paying with dining dollars and we ask if the payment is dining dollars, JUST SAY YES. Showing us your ID MEANS NOTHING. An ID can be used as a payment method for any number of things, including DD, Community Dining, Triton Cash, or PerQ. Just do us the common decency of answering the question instead of standing silently and showing us your ID. 

5) Dont try to scam us buy putting your ID on top of someone else‚Äôs ID and then tapping theirs. We aren‚Äôt stupid and it‚Äôs really awkward for us to have to call you out on that. ",,"serious, complaint",,Tue,3.0,3.0,45.24800000000003,47.469999999999935,50.5,0.047,0.869,0.084,0.7285,20

I am really uncomfortable talking to other people about it and that's why I'm going to ask for some solid relationship advice on this page.
I have been in a relationship with my girlfriend for quite some time but soon she shifted and we were in a long distance relationship. We both feel like we really like each other and although there are challenges like every other relationship, I feel like in trying to be too perfect in the relationship I have made myself uncomfortable in it. We both give each other enough space and spend time apart. Although she makes time for me I feel that her new set of friends takes away her priority to me. I'm sorry but I want a relationship were we both come first for each other and it's sad to see how I have to fight for my spot. Also as she moved away from her house, she has gotten more independence and is experiencing things she never did with me and I hate it. I try to be supportive and caring but I'm just jealous when she's hanging 24*7 with her friends (and obviously guys make me more insecure) and also when she goes on trips with them. I know it's important to understand in a long distance that her life is still to continue and expand and I try to act normal on it. But it fucking sucks, she sees right through it and it has been repeating for long and I can't hold these standards anymore. I just want to be selfish in love and even though at the bottom of my heart I know she really loves me, it's just that she has this friendly personality and gets along with guys really well.

13742,2019-05-13 15:08:32,"My boyfriend has a secure folder for nudes and videos. A few months into our relationship, he got a new phone and decided to only transfer over our videos. When I saw the folder, however, there was still a video of him fucking his old fwb and he said he had no idea how it transferred over and he couldn't figure out how to delete it so he just left it. 

I try not to let jealousy influence my actions, so I haven't said anything other than the fact that he still had that video bothered me. He agreed it was wrong for him to still have that video, but never said anything about deleting it so I don't know if he still has it.

The fwb is his coworker and they stayed close friends after they stopped hooking up, until for some reason she turned cold to him and talked shit about him to his friends. This ended up isolating my bf from his friend group and he took it super hard. This isn't the first time she threw him under the bus. Still, they follow each other and stuff. Recently I guess she started to warm up to him again and they've been talking at work and stuff. 

The thing is, I come to work with him when I don't have class and just do my homework there (he works at a boba shop) because he gets lonely and frustrated by customers while on shift sometimes. It does make me very jealous when he has me come to his work and he ends up not even talking to me, and basically spends all his time talking to the fwb instead. Granted, they are working together so I guess its easier to talk to her than to me, but recently its been bothering me so much that I have to leave and walk to the Starbucks across the street instead.

I suppose I'm just venting here because I'm really frustrated that he would let someone into his life like that. I definitely have a huge personal bias since I did literally see my boyfriend fuck this girl. On a larger picture, he's always tried to stay friends with his exes, but they end up not talking anymore because the girls  dislike him after a while for some reason (like the fwb). I'm admittedly glad they don't talk, but it makes me uncomfortable that his doors are always open to them. I feel guilty being this bothered because their falling out really hurt him and hes glad to have his friend back.

	So at the beginning of the school year, I came to college still kinda together with my girlfriend. We were gonna try long distance but we were gonna be far enough apart that we‚Äôd only ever be able to see each other on breaks. Things ended pretty quickly into the beginning of fall quarter, but we wanted to stay friends. But pretty much from when we broke up, she treated me terribly. She kept cancelling on plans to talk (or hang out when we were on break) and sometimes she didn‚Äôt even say she was cancelling and just went out to do something else instead. And through all of this, she still tried to tell me that she cared about me. She even bought a plane ticket to fly here and visit at the beginning of winter quarter. By the beginning of winter quarter though, I was really pissed off at all of her immature behavior and almost considered telling her not to come, but I didn‚Äôt in the end. About a week after she left SD, I decided to cut her out of my life because she was being a shitty friend, and conversations that we had when she visited really opened my eyes to some truths about her. She basically has no moral compass and wasn‚Äôt really bothered at all when one of her friends sexually assaulted someone else. She‚Äôs also extraordinarily immature and irresponsible and needs help doing the most basic tasks of living. I think cutting her out of my life was one of the best decisions I‚Äôve ever made because there‚Äôs a lot of things that I just couldn‚Äôt see when I was in a relationship with her, but I realized that she was really abusive. She would get mad at me for not knowing exactly what she was thinking a lot. She‚Äôd also say that we should break up, and expect me to convince her that we shouldn‚Äôt if she was unhappy with me. One time, when she called me over the summer and said that she thought we should break up, I told her that if she couldn‚Äôt handle long distance then it was fine and we should. She then got really mad at me because I was supposed to tell her that we should stay together. She even brought this incident up to some of our friends as if I had done something wrong by agreeing with her. Also, she was always wanting to do sexual activities. If I didn‚Äôt want to but she did, she‚Äôd get mad at me. She basically told me that if I was attracted to her then I would want to. She didn‚Äôt ever consider that sometimes I wasn‚Äôt in the mood or I didn‚Äôt want to do certain things. In the summer before college, she kept putting a lot of pressure on me to have intercourse (an activity which I have no interest in). I tried saying no, saying that we shouldn‚Äôt do it. But she kept pressing me and would ask, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you want to?‚Äù And I wasn‚Äôt really sure how to respond ever, because if I said no, she would get mad because that would mean that ‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt attracted to her.‚Äù I really didn‚Äôt want too though and my answers of ‚Äúno‚Äù weren‚Äôt working and she couldn‚Äôt take the hint. Luckily I was never forced to do that with her, mostly because for the end of our relationship, I mostly just stopped doing any kind of sexual activities with her.
There‚Äôs a part of me that doesn‚Äôt understand how I let myself be caught up in a relationship with somebody who‚Äôs so horrible (and it‚Äôs not just me, she‚Äôs lost a number of friends since starting college). On the other hand, I think I know so much more now. I know everything that I don‚Äôt want next time. And, I‚Äôm happy being single after basically being tethered to her for a year and I‚Äôve met people who are so much better now. I guess the story has a good ending. Some of you may know who I am, some may not, but I‚Äôd like to thank everyone here who has made this year so amazing!",,"serious, sex, dating, abuse",,Mon,12.0,21.0,91.0,89.17999999999982,115.93400000000007,0.127,0.737,0.136,0.5198,00

Oh, completely irrelevant to the rest of this story, but it might also be of some interest and humor value to you to know that my other efforts to impress/humor/not appear ignorant in front of/humiliate myself in front of her included learning a few words in Afrikaans that are totally useless in polite conversation (well, except for ‚ÄúHello‚Äù and ‚ÄúGoodbye‚Äù), developing my impression of a white South African (which for some reasons unknown to me had flairs of Indian in it), spending around $20 on two pounds of frozen boerewors and another $50 on South African groceries (drinks, meat pies, Nik-Naks, rusks, etc.), picking up some NorCal slang, and acquiring a metric crap-ton of waterfowl related puns, among a couple of other things. Ahh, the things I do for love.

Anyways, back to the story. In the end, my quest for this lady ended in a great big fat failure and I had begun to think that I acquired all of this knowledge about South Africa and apartheid for naught (although admittedly, both topics had interested me for a time even before I met this lady). 

Then Tritons for Palestine set up that great wall on Library Walk and I got into a bit of a natter with some folks, some of whom were pro-Palestine, some of whom were anti-Palestine, and some of whom were absolutely neutral. Some of the people in the group (particularly those in the anti-Palestine camp) didn‚Äôt completely understand or vehemently disputed the connection between the situation in Palestine and apartheid South Africa and for the first time ever, I was able to whip out all of the newfound knowledge I had and put it to good use.

1) If you were one of those people who reported content on 3.0 that led to that group‚Äôs dissolution, I hope you‚Äôve learned your lesson. If you reported content with the intent to get 3.0 dissolved, then may you never get laid again (or ever, if you‚Äôve never gotten any before) and may your genitals see as much action as a restaurant kitchen in North Korea.
2) REPORT TO THE ADMINS, NOT TO ZUCCBOI
3) If you want to see this new community flourish as much as the old one, try to get as many people on this page as possible. Tell all your fellow Tritons about it, get them to join, and then tell them to tell all of their fellow Tritons about it. You possess the ability to make 4.0 as great if not greater than 3.0. So do your part to help us and yourself out, ladies and gents.
4) TELL THEM TO REPORT ANY CONTENT TO THE ADMINS AND NOT ZUCCBOI

When the professor stops actually answering your question and says ""I don't know what your point is"" after you've spent more time than it takes for me to go to the bathroom and get back trying to say something, its probably a sign that you've been talking for too long.

I applied to UCLA, UCI, and UC Berkeley as a transfer student and got in  to all from UCSD: however, I do not know if I should take up the offer to go to either of them.

Some background info: I am a humanities major who is doing premed. My main reason for wanting to transfer to one of these is because they all offer a major I want to study that is not offered at UCSD. On the other hand, I feel like it would affect me negatively in the future in terms of premed prereqs. (For reference, I have only taken BILD 1-3, and Chem 6 series) I would be forced to take the Ochem series for engineers (aka non-bio majors) at UCLA, and ochem at UC berkeley, well gradee deflation much? In addition, UCSD is weird in the BILD 4/LD bio lab is not really equivalent to much? On the other hand, I really want to major and study ancient egyptology at these schools.

So the trade off is that to study at a school that has what I want, i would have to end up taking (subjectively) significantly premed courses. Honestly, I would love to transfer for my major, but if it ruins my GPA completely, I would obviously decide to not transfer.

13486,2019-05-09 00:15:21,"What really bothers me is how people are simply killing animals all the time. Like why? I find it so stupid how people go out killing animals when there's an animal attack. For example, we see a shark attack and then the next few years, we start going out there and hunting sharks. Sharks don't even attack humans on purpose. First of all, you're in their fucking territory and they have the right to defend themselves and home. Don't fucking expect the animals to not defend their homes when you're fucking in their territory. We fucking have the right to shoot people for being in our property like the fucking wild animals that we are but when an animal is doing the same exact thing, it's fucking like the world is going to end. Second of all, most animals are fucking curious so they ""nibble"" and sometimes it just so fucking happens that it's labelled as an ""attack"". Dogs fucking come up and sniff for curiosity or they fucking teeth and we think it's cute. Sorry sharks don't fucking come up to you and poke you with their fins as curiosity. Their way of being curious is having a nibble; they're just strong jaws. That's why people in fucking cages when shark diving get ""attacked"". Sharks don't know what the fuck is that thing doing in the water and they want to know. We are allowed to just waltz into any fucking animal territory and study their homes and behavior how ever we like because of curiosity without thinking about invading their territory. There's fucking 16 annual shark attacks and 1 fatal shark attack EVERY. TWO. FUCKING. YEARS. You have a higher chance of dying to a fucking bullet ant than a shark. What's with people killing animals and poaching?!?!? Who in the right fucking mind looks into an animals eyes and fucking start cutting their horns off? That's like having other fucking people coming up to you and taking your fucking organs and selling it for money, which is the fucking black market organ trade. That's so fucking wrong but you're doing the same exact shit to animals but because we're on the top of the food chain or we are a more advanced organism living in this fucking world, it gives us the right to fucking do that to other animals but when it's done to us, it's fucking war. Don't fucking get mad at me and say shit like ""there's people out there who do good for these animals"". Yea no shit, there's people out there but there's also fucking good cops our there but all we fucking remember is those police officers who shoot black people just because they can. It's because we're wearing a uniform that represent the human race and there's fucking a lot of people who are out there making these adorable and loving animals go extinct. This is why I wish there's more diseases like cancer and the bubonic plague to fucking kill more humans; we're over populating this fucking world anyway and killing other animals just to sustain our selfish asses. Yea, say what if my family members get cancer? Honestly, that's just how life goes and it sucks. I'm willing to exchange 2.53 billion people for all the animals that aren't SUPPOSED to go extinct and have them back. It fucking sucks thinking how there's only 2 FUCKING NORTHERN WHITE RHINOS LEFT. It fucking sucks how some of us will never know how a fucking gorilla, tigers, sea turtles, orangutans, elephants, rhinos, or even saolas look like because we're too busy fucking killing other animals to keep ourselves alive. Don't give me crap about this is just survival of the fittest. These animals belong here and they are the reason why we have life on this shitty planet. I'm tired of seeing people treating other living things like shit. I'm tired of seeing people not know what belongs in the fucking trash or recycle or compost.

Support for Israel in the United States should not be a monolith, the current Knesset government is ripe for criticism. However, this does not mean that all criticism of Israel is fair, or even truthful. From one liberal to many, here are the checks you can go through yourself to determine whether or not you‚Äôre an antisemite when you criticize Israel.

1. Am I demonizing Israel in the same way Jews are demonized by open anti-semites?
Example: instead of ‚ÄúThe state of Israel kills Palestinian babies! They‚Äôre evil!‚Äù say ‚Äúwhen the IDF responds with lethal force to rocks and firebombs being thrown at them in Gaza‚Äôs protests, children are often among the dead. I condemn Israel‚Äôs military for their actions but why do Palestinian protesters feel the need to bring their children to what they know will be a lethal backlash?‚Äù (Answer: Hamas pays its martyrs)

2. Am I delegitimizing Israel‚Äôs right to exist, even though self-determination is the same bedrock argument for Palestinian statehood?
Example: instead of ‚ÄúIsrael illegally stole land given to Palestine in the UN partition plan of 1947‚Äù, say, ‚ÄúWhile Palestinian leadership at the time walked away from the 1947 plan, it is long overdue for Palestinians to be given autonomous control over the West Bank and Gaza‚Äù (as long as said control isn‚Äôt government by terrorist organization but that‚Äôs my opinion showing again)

3. Am I applying a double standard to Israel that doesn‚Äôt apply to other countries?
Example: Calling for political and systemic violence against Israel for civilian casualties during war when only 2% of the casualties from President Obama‚Äôs drone strikes in Pakistan were known military leaders, and had over a thousand civilian injuries.

The Israel-Palestine conflict is one of the most difficult political topics to navigate. Both sides commit routine acts of murder because the other side won‚Äôt stop, and excessive, unchecked, improper criticism of both sides can lead to anti-semitism and islamophobia.

He, Barr, Mnuchin, and countless others are claiming he is completely exonerated, and didnt collude, but then are stopping investigations from obtaining documents that, if they are telling the truth, would clear him. They literally have no reason to hide his tax returns, the Mueller report, etc. unless they are hiding something that could be detrimental to his presidency. We deserve the truth. 

Had Obama done anything REMOTELY close to this, Republicans would have said we have a tyrannical government and used their 2nd amendment rights by now on him. But no, Obama's biggest scandal was wearing a bike helmet when cycling once.  

For the Christians that support trump, I'm a Christian, but notice far too often that the majority of my religion and pastors support trump. This is insane. He has no regard for our faith and is playing the majority of us like fools, saying stuff like ""he brought back saying Merry Christmas"" to pander to the gullible among us, which I'm realizing is far too many. Nearly all of his policies go directly against what we stand for.

I know that there is separation of church and state, but for those Christians, stop and ask yourself ""what would Jesus do?"" Would he really want tax cuts for the rich and corporations and to throw millions of people off healthcare? Would he really want us to put a wall up and stop people from coming here for a better life, or tell those fleeing dictatorships and war torn countries to go back because we, as the richest country in the world, cant help them? Would he really want us to continue to pollute and destroy the one planet he gave us when there are plenty cleaner alternatives just because some rich people's businesses would go under? If you think yes to any of these, you are utterly mistaken for what Jesus stood for. Jesus always looked out for the poor and low among us and trump would never even voluntarily say hi to a person like that unless he knew it would be caught on camera and get him a few votes. 

It doesnt matter if you call yourself Christian, if you don't at least try to act like he did and help others, even strangers, like he calls on us to do, you are not a real Christian and he will judge you that way.

She is kinda condescending. Her opinions kinda reign over everyone else's. She is pretty liberal which I am too but when talking about political stuff she just seems to be static in her opinions. Like there's no discussion or desire to explore the topic, it's just her talking over until I agree usually it's fine since we are usually on the same side of the spectrum but it is annoying to not be able to say my opinion on the matter even if its the same. She also seems to already have an opinion of me or my situation when I go to her for advice. Like assumptions before I get to explain to her. 
I know some of you are gonna tell me to call her out on it or talk to her but I have a feeling if I start this conversation she is just gonna dig into me and my flaws. Not only that, but also our friend group is probably going to back her since they are closer with her than me.
I know I am making her out to be a horrible person overall. She's not. It's just certain moments that stay in my mind.
Also to add: (still referring to the roommate) I know it's midterm season, but that doesn't mean you get to be a bitch. Like we all have midterms and are super busy and stressed, but I still have the common decency to say hi and at least have a little small talk.

Maybe it's because i'm more conservative? (never really dated or partied, just never got around to it or just wasn't my scene) Or maybe because they were all friends before meeting me?
I'm not sure but I get really insecure about being the one on the sideline since it's always seemed that way in the past. In high school, I jumped from friend group to friend group until I found people I really connected with but then college happened and we became separated.

I am horrified that that is what we have devolved to in this country. Teenagers are killed and injured while at school, and just the fact that it happened isn't heinous enough. No, of course not, not when we have similar incidents constantly, and some of them result in dozens of deaths, in actual children dying, in people dying while they pray. After the mosque shooting in New Zealand, the government promised action and took action, yet here we are in the United States of America, and we have jack shit on the national level. 

So to you assholes who think we live in the best country in the world and that we don't need common sense gun legislation, remember that today, a teenager went to school, got shot, and died for absolutely no reason.

To those with friends, reach out and ask them how they're doing. Just that simple action can mean the world to someone.

Yes I have more traits than just being a 'nice guy' that others do appreciate: giving, empathetic, strong valued, adventurous, ambitious, etc
I am more than looks and I know relationships are more than looks, however most of college culture (who are not religious, like me) cannot relate to me bc I don't go to parties, drink, etc.
These aspects are what I define as being a goodboi. I am more than just these traits still.
My point is that these traits are no longer appreciated in this society practically in college social life though they are voiced out, and it's sad for ppl like me who have been raised and built into this unwanted form.
And though you say that being a 'nice guy' is the most basic of human decency my point is that the vast majority of relationships do not have that requirement and tend towards acts that are currently against my values.
I'm not saying these confessions to gain pity (I have enough self pity) but rather to gain advice on how to move forward to be more socially/relationally wanted. Should I ammend my values?

Truth be told, I have a rough and I think fairly accurate picture of what kind of person she is judging from what I‚Äôve seen (in person and through our org‚Äôs group chat) and what I‚Äôve been told by others. I didn‚Äôt mention this in my previous posts out of concerns for anonymity, but I fell for her not because she was just a very physically attractive lady (which was absolutely was), but because she was a passionate, patient, and caring soul with a big heart. She was someone who looked out for each and every one of us in the org no matter how well or little she knew us to make sure we were safe and sound (physically, mentally, and emotionally), someone who was a self-professed politics and military strategy nerd (which I find very neat, since I‚Äôm also a political/military/history buff) with a dark and sometimes morbid sense of humor (which I also really appreciate), and someone who doesn‚Äôt take shit from anyone else (which is probably the #1 reason why I fell for her; she was proud of who she was and comfortable with herself). 

Does all of this mean she definitely would‚Äôve been as good as I made her out to be? No, but she certainly piqued my interest to the point where I decided it was worth a shot. I may not have a solid answer on who she was precisely, but I had a rough and solid enough sketch, and I liked what I saw. 

Was I aware it could‚Äôve been a really short term relationship considering that she‚Äôs graduating in 4 weeks? Yes, but to be honest, even if we didn‚Äôt make it past June, at least it we would‚Äôve had those couple of months with each other, a couple of months of mutual happiness and companionship, and I think that‚Äôs pretty worthwhile too. As Lord Tennyson said, ‚ÄúTis better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all.‚Äù (Yeah, I admit I‚Äôm a bit of a hopeless romantic)

The reason I wasn‚Äôt more proactive with her, that I didn‚Äôt take more risks and fight like hell and allowed myself to just coast was because I saw her as my boss, essentially. She was my superior in my org and where I‚Äôm from, it is absolutely inappropriate to develop romantic feelings for your higher-ups. You maintained a courteous, professional, and somewhat distanced relationship with them and that was that. I struggled to fight this mindset throughout the five months we had known each other. I couldn‚Äôt convince myself that she wouldn‚Äôt be offended if I tried to get to know her better even when it was blatantly obvious that she wouldn‚Äôt (she had the org over at her place multiple times for drinks and party games and she joined in the fun with us). The whole concept just felt very foreign to me. In the end, I think it‚Äôs this mindset that caused me grief. I personally think I did have a shot with her, because from what I could tell, she and her boyfriend hooked up very recently. But I let my mind, which demanded strict respectful formality towards her at all times, prevail over my heart and common sense. Thus, I stopped myself from being bold with her and getting into a position where I could‚Äôve shot my shot sooner and preempted the rest of this story. Essentially, I was in the right place at the right time, originally, and then I simply stalled for far too long. 

Oh well. I should have done better, much better, but at least I was able to catch my mistakes from this time around, and that‚Äôs a pretty damn good consolation prize, if you ask me. 
I‚Äôve decided to put the focus back on myself again in the meanwhile. I‚Äôm trying to get back on top of classwork (I‚Äôve always been a first-class procrastinator, hahahaha) as well as trying to get back into the gym again (but it‚Äôs always so damn hard to find the time to do so, hahahaha). Life has gotten much better for me over these past few days, now that I‚Äôve made peace with myself over this whole episode.

I‚Äôm pleased to hear that my story touched you. I was not expecting the outpouring of sympathy and support that I got from the Confessions Community. I didn‚Äôt think so many of you would be interested in my story That genuinely took me by surprise and I am genuinely very deeply touched by that. Again, thank you all so very much.

13317,2019-05-07 11:56:06,"Tl;dr I Think i have developed mild depression from this shitty school.

After being here for two years, I have come to realize how sad it is just to be at UCSD.  I know that everyone describes this school as ""socially dead"" but its really been getting to me lately with just how depressing it is to be here. I'm writing this in biomed and i look around and all I see is people stuck to there computer screens looking at lecture slides or YouTube, waiting for their next exam. Its not even in libraries, its everywhere i go. People spend week after week studying to maintain their GPA because its ""so important to them"" and because the job market is so competitive now. Most teachers and students don't even seem to care about education, they only care about the end result (yes there are a few outliers, there are people here that enjoy their lives but from my perspective its a very select few). The more I look at it the more everyone to me looks so spineless; they only care about their grades, they only care about internships or career fairs, they don't even care if they like the shitty major their in (most people I've talked to hate their major or lie and say ""oh its interesting"" when they complain about it every other fucking second).

And i feel like ive become one of these people. Ive become a spineless slave to the american education system. and I know this sounds like a rant, ill probably get comments like ""Op, youre only saying this because youre not doing as well as you want to,"" but this is how i truly feel. I pretty much hide the fact that im depressed to my friends, family and my SO. I was fine in high school because it was so easy for me compared to college, but I feel as if all of my time and energy now is put into just passing my fucking classes. The more I think about it the more i feel like I don't belong here. I hate my major and Im only doing it for the money involved in my career path. The fact that I fail almost every test because of one question thats worth literally half of the test pisses me off because basing my GPA off of a few questions is a shit way to measure my knowledge. sometimes i feel like id rather work at a fucking Taco Bell than live a life where UCSD Administration is shitting on my mental health. This definitely isnt all I have to say, there's quite a lot that I'm irritated with at this school and its general student and faculty body (as im sure most of you are too) but I'll probably post it in a different confession post considering this one is too fucking long.",[redacted],"urgent, serious, sad",,Tue,16.0,20.0,68.32800000000016,55.06800000000016,52.41599999999985,0.123,0.714,0.162,0.9721,11

13192,2019-05-07 02:14:55,"I've got a friend who is very, very suicidal and im not sure what exactly to do. He literally bought sodium nitrite online because it's a ""quick and painless"" way to die (I've read that it's definitely neither of those), and he's waiting on it to arrive. He wasnt planning on using it immediately, just keeping it as sort of a peace of mind, but he's telling me now that he doesn't think he'll make it to the end of the week. I've been begging him to get help for a while, and he's calling CAPS tomorrow, but he's planning on withholding enough information to prevent him from getting institutionalized. I know that being in a psych ward doesn't really do anything but physically prevent you from hurting yourself, that he'd still be suicidal when he leaves, and that he'd rather die than go back to a psych ward, but he needs serious help ASAP. He has the philosophy that when someone wants to commit, they should be allowed to do so, but he hasn't really tried any treatments. He's passionate and incredibly talented in what he does, he's done really important work with some of the comp sci professors on campus, has internships lined up for summer, and is almost guaranteed to get into grad school here because of the profs he's worked with (he wants a phD). 
This bout of depression was all triggered by a breakup. He's definitely had issues before, but right now it's a response to his ex. I don't want to disrespect his ideology on suicide or anything, and I don't want to put him in a psych ward (they really fucking suck), but he needs it. I'm positive that he'll kill himself if he doesn't get sent to one. He has so much passion and drive in him, but he's got years of unaddressed mental health issues and alcoholism he's never addressed.
I know he'd be pissed if I told anyone, but I'm pretty sure I'm gonna have to alert campus police or something. God, I don't know where to begin. I know how it feels to be in his shoes but fuck, now I'm on the other side.

13264,2019-05-06 21:39:16,"I'm a UCSD student, and I dated a guy for a few months who doesn't go to college at all. My ex was emotionally abusive throughout our whole relationship. I tried to end it after a month but it dragged on to over 6 fucking months because every time I tried to cut ties with him, he would either call the police and tell them I was suicidal or cut himself and claim he was depressed. It irks me so much because I've struggled with anxiety and depression for years, and whenever I broke up with him he'd pull the ""depression"" card to manipulate me into giving him attention despite never having a history of mental illness. I finally ended things after he anally raped me, after which he would post all these sadboy instagram stories about how he is now depressed and told everyone that I left him for another guy. I did find a great person and am in an amazing relationship with now, but that was 6 months after I tried to get away from his toxic ass. 

His sister went out of her way to dm me and attacked me for leaving her poor sweet little brother, who ""loved"" me so much, for another guy. Allegedly, I would also ""threaten to kill myself over him"" and he was better off without me. Honestly, its no surprise that he would whine and mope about the breakup to paint himself as a victim, but its infuriating for my mental health issues to be misappropriated in order to set me up as some crazy ex girlfriend, and its downright painful to be accused of these things when this guy is literally my abuser and my rapist. 

The worst part is that one of his best friends, who is a UCSD student, saw the abuse and actually helped me end the relationship -- yet he still hangs out with him and invites him to campus to smoke and skate. I always see him on social hanging out here and it just terrifies me that I might one day have to see him again.

13243,2019-05-06 20:29:56,"I fall in love so easily, and when I do, I fall really hard.

Being hopelessly romantic sucks because I have so much love to give and a lot of people are just so great. How can you just pick one person to fall in love and spend your life with when there are plenty of fantastic people in the world that you can fall in love with? I'm not down with an open-relationship or any kind of polygamy so that's out of the question. I'll maybe try it out but it doesn't really appeal to me so probably not.

I just want to have romantic walks on the beach, hold hands, and embrace so many people. I'm not too into sex or anything since I'm asexual but I absolutely crave romance. I guess you can say that I'm in love with falling in love, heh. I always notice when I'm swooning, sighing, or daydreaming about people and I can't help but smile since the feeling of being flustered by love is so sublime, it fills me up with so much happiness and emotion that I have to scream into my pillow. The blood rushing to my face and my heart skipping a beat when thinking of or spending time with any of my crushes are two of the greatest feeling in the world.

I don't know if any of them caught on but I don't know what I'd do if I started dating someone again then start feeling love for someone that's not my partner. I don't think that I deserve anyone spending love on me because I can't spend mine on just them... I would never want to break someone's heart or hurt anyone because I can't control my emotions. I'd never physically or emotionally cheat on someone, I just don't know how my partner would react to how I feel for others. I don't think that they'd understand, I know that I don't understand myself most of the time. Would they be mad? Certainly they would be sad. What if the relationship ends sour because of my feeling for someone else? I don't ever want to put anyone through that.

Maybe I don't deserve to be loved myself, maybe I'm just selfish by choosing how to spend my love. I'm not entirely certain. Maybe the love that I constantly feel inside could be spent on just one person one day, I hope that's true, we'll just have to see. Maybe I just think that the feeling I have in droves is love and I never experienced true love. Just the thought of experiencing a feeling greater than what I feel now, especially for one person, makes me so excited and warm, it's probably the third greatest feeling. For now I will remain single and enjoy the feeling of loving everyone.

If I had a positive interaction with you, I might have some sort of crush on you. If I ask or find out your name, I probably have a crush on you. If we're friends and we hang out, I definitely have a crush on you. Romantic or platonic, I love you. Everyone is beautiful, don't get caught up too much about your looks. Personalities are much more easier to fall in love with (A genuine smile and pretty eyes are to die for though!! I love looking into someone else's eyes!!!!).

I'll see all of your lovely faces around campus. Stop being such strangers!

      I have seen many broken hearts on campus and I always tell them it's gonna be just fine and there is always someone special waiting for them, just have patience. I try to motivate them but, in reality it's me who frikkking needs it the most. 

      It's not that's I haven't tried. I have asked a couple of girls whether they want to hangout or not, and all I got are rejections wrapped in msgs like, ""...sorry i'm not looking for anything right now"" , "" ...you seem to be pretty cool but I have a boyfriend"".  IT SUCKS. I didn't ask them out on a date or anything. Just flexible.

    Let me tell you all one brutal truth. The person you call boyfriend isn't any different. It's just dumb fucking luck. He got the opportunity to know you more. At the end of the day he invested all those hours just to get you. 

 Oh shoot, I realize that I shouldn't be complaining and be a man. But when you like someone and the other person doesn't feel the same it's painful. It hurts.

I become consumed by rage to the point where I can‚Äôt believe what someone tells me, regardless of whether I know it to be true or not. I‚Äôve contemplated suicide more times in my life than I can count. When I was around 14, I was actually going to do it, but someone sent an anonymous tip to the police. I was almost forcibly hospitalized, but I was able to avoid that by agreeing to therapy. Therapy has been a mixed bag for me. My first one blamed me for my parents marital issues and overall just berated me (it was group therapy). My second one was a lot better, but I stopped feeling better as sessions continued. She also didn‚Äôt believe that I had depression, but thought I fit the description for adjustment disorder. I look at myself and don‚Äôt know who I am anymore. When my emotions consume me, I‚Äôm unable to think clearly and I isolate myself from all of my friends. I overreact and push them away, knowing full well what I‚Äôm doing but not being able to do anything. I also begin to disassociate, and feel like I‚Äôm not the person inside my own body. It feels like I‚Äôm another person watching all of this happen before my eyes. At times, I don‚Äôt feel any emotion at all, just an absolute emptiness. I feel so fucking helpless.

13060,2019-05-05 02:28:42,"Last fall quarter, I met this girl. I didn't think anything about it at the time, I thought we just hit if off really well as friends. She told me she's bi, but I didn't think much of it.

But a few weeks pass, and I start to develop feelings for her. I was so sure I was straight, I had never been so confused in my life. I tried to pretend for a few months, but one night I just couldn't lie to myself anymore. I'm still confused on my sexuality, but I know for sure I like this girl.

I tried to dismiss my feelings because I know my family won't be supportive, and I don't like standing out in a crowd. But it was absolutely impossible. I had never fallen for anyone this hard before. NEVER, not even to the slightest degree. And the feelings only grew stronger as I got to know her better. We were really good friends, and sometimes I thought I got signals from her. Guess I was wrong, though.

Over winter break, I confessed my feelings. Her first reaction was to ask me if I was sure, and my heart fell. She basically told me that it wasn't a good time for her, that she still needed to figure some things out. I, of course, respected that. A few weeks later I asked her about it in person. tl;dr she said that she doesn't not like me but also added that she doesn't know when she'll be ""better"" mentally to start a relationship (but she didn't tell me exactly what the issue was), that it might take a few months or a few years. Me being infatuated with her, I told her I'd wait.

Even though we both agreed to remain friends, things just haven't been quite normal since. I fell into the most depressive state in my life I've ever been, questioning my feelings, questioning why this had to happen to me, of all people. It was almost as if it was worse than if she had just flat out told me that she didn't like me back. And I hadn't realized that I had, for so many months, depended on this girl for my happiness. Get through studying for this test, I would tell myself, and you can hang with her afterwards.

I knew I needed to get over her, knew that I needed to be okay with being alone. And now, a few months later, I'm glad to say that I'm better. I still love this girl, but I'm in a much better mental state. The only problem is that whenever I see her, all I feel is sad. The jittery feeling I once felt every time I saw her had been replaced by a tremendous heap of just plain old sadness.

And just today when we were in a group, she said she doesn't like banking on the idea that one day she'll find her someone. I don't know if she said that purposely, or if she thinks I've gotten over her.

Either way, I haven't. I still dream of us having a future only to stop myself and feel like absolute shit and all gross on the inside. It would probably be easier if I stop being friends with her altogether, but I feel like that would just be a dick move, and our mutual friends (who don't know this is happening) would definitely know something is up.

Anyways, I've left out some plot details because they pose too great of a risk in ruining my anonymity, but this is the gist of what has happened. Please let me know if you have any tips for me or if you've ever been in the same or similar situation before.

A little known fact is that back in 1912, Hellmann‚Äôs mayonnaise was manufactured in England. In fact, the Titanic was carrying 12,000 jars of the condiment scheduled for delivery in Vera Cruz, Mexico, which was to be the next port of call for the great ship after its stop in New York. This would have been the largest single shipment of mayonnaise ever delivered to Mexico but as we know, the great ship did not make it to New York.

The ship hit an iceberg and sank and the cargo was forever lost. The people of Mexico, who were crazy about mayonnaise and were eagerly awaiting its delivery, were disconsolate at the loss.

I'm kind of an outsider since I haven't been in the same sequence with them throughout their years in the major and kinda showed up out of nowhere. I didn't really get to know a lot of them in the class we shared last quarter, but I know who the driven/smart ones are compared to the unmotivated/slow ones. So I'm half frustrated that I ended up in a group with people I know procrastinate and that are slow to understand stuff. Sure, they're my ""friends"" -  I helped them on homework they procrastinated on and needed help on last minute. And I did choose them as my partners. But working with them so far has really been a one-sided affair, with only me contributing to the project. To some extent, I make solace with myself by saying that, if I didn't step up and ask them to be in my group, then others would have to be dissatisfiedin having them as partners and for their grades to suffer instead... Thankfully, I was able to get a good amout of the project work done, which will allow me to keep the project smooth sailing and help them understand what's going on, so they don't try to fight me and (mistakenly) tell me I'm wrong (which they have done for past homeworks because they don't use the right information!)

12948,2019-05-03 17:37:34,"Hello team! It's the guy from #12478 (and also #12266, #11152, #9578, and #9299; yeah, I polled this group a lot haha) and I'm here to give you guys the results of me shooting my shot (as some folks requested).

So I met her at Geisel today (a day late due to scheduling conflicts) to inform her that I was leaving the org that we are both a part of (for totally unrelated reasons). I had planned to save asking her out on a date until the end of that brief chat. During the course of this conversation, she went on about her hectic midterm schedule and how the week has been for her thus far. 

Then she said, ""I had planned to meet up with my boyfriend, but then we couldn't, because I was so busy.""

And then my heart shattered into a million pieces.

We had known each other for five months, and in all the time that I've known her, she's never brought him up in any way until now. This was the first time I have ever heard of her boyfriend. (Although admittedly, I felt in my bones for the longest time that she may be taken, and oh, how it hurts for your worst fears to finally be realized).

So with all that in mind, I chose to end our conversation with a simple farewell and not pop the question or even reveal my true feelings about her, since I felt that would've been wrong and disrespectful and immature and undignified.

What is getting me mad and depressed now wasn't anything she did. She did nothing wrong. I'm not mad at myself either. I have concluded that I did everything I possibly could given what I was given. What's getting me is the fact that this is the third woman in a row I've had a major crush who turned out to be already taken when I pop the question. 

I've never had a girlfriend before and fate is making it soul-crushingly hard for me to find one. I've never ever had a fair shot when it came to shooting my shot (that is, I've never got to ask out someone who was single at the time of my asking). Now, I understand that them's the breaks and that's just how things turn out sometimes, but it still doesn't stop me from getting mad about it (and I'm sure a number of you can sympathize with that sentiment).

I don't look for casual hookups or just sex or anything of that nature. I want something that is meaningful and deep and real with someone that's kindly and mature and sensitive and fun. Consequently, I'm somewhat picky with the people that I crush on. So I've never had very many crushes on people (two in the past two years).

I'm trying as hard as I can to keep the negative thoughts away, the thoughts of worthlessness and being completely undateable and the like (as well as the typical thoughts of ""Oh, I'll never find anyone quite like her"" that I typically have around this time). But it's hard to feel like you're worthy of someone or someone will ever be interested in you or you'll ever find someone when the powers that be keep leading you to wonderful women who are taken. It truly makes you wonder what the fuck you did to deserve something like this.

There's also a bittersweet finality to all of this. I've crushed on her for five months and now all of that planning and hopes and dreams and preparation is done. It's all over, and I feel this great emptiness in my heart.

(If you're wondering why I didn't ask earlier, it was because there were conflicting commitments on Sun God weekend (to her and the rest of our org) that I had to fulfill and it would not have been appropriate if I asked before those commitments were fulfilled. It might've made things quite awkward, so I'm happy I held off from that.)

If any of you have any tips on how to move on from the pain that I feel in my heart right now (or words of encouragement or advice or anything of that nature), then please do let me know, because I don't want to resort to anything stupid and potentially dangerous like drinking the pain away.

So yeah, that's the thrilling conclusion of that story.

Confessions community, thank you so very much for all the support and advice that you have given me (as well as anything you'll give me now in the comments section here). I read through every single comment you put on my posts and took them to heart. You really are a magnificent bunch.

And so, to end this post, I just want to say this:
""If you're reading this (and you know who you are), well now you know how I feel about you and what kind of state I'm in now. But please don't worry about me. Things like this happen. It's all a part of the natural cycle of life and I will recover and move on from it. I still stand by every single thing I said to you today on the third floor of Geisel, how much of a lovely person you are and how it's people like you make the world a better place for us all. I earnestly hope that your boyfriend counts his blessings each and every day for having someone as wonderful as yourself in his life. I don't know if our paths will cross again in the future, but if it doesn't, I wish you nothing but the very best of luck (not that you'll really need it) as well as success and happiness wherever you go in whatever you do.

My anxiety has been getting so much worse and not until this quarter that I said no more I can‚Äôt keep living like this. So I seemed help from CAPS. I‚Äôve been dealing with it for a very long time but never went to a psychiatrist or psychologist. Just a high school counselor who was of no help to me. 

Having to deal with anxiety is such a horrible thing. I‚Äôve dealt with it since I was 12. And I‚Äôm surprised I‚Äôve made it this far because dealing with suicidal thoughts was also another thing that pops in with anxiety. People say ‚Äújust do something to get your mind off of it‚Äù well I played a sport most of my life, played a musical instrument, was part of ASB, was part of the top 10% of my class...well nothing worked. So it‚Äôs not as easy to ignore it. I could be having the best time and then out of no where I lose it....

To those that don‚Äôt know what people with anxiety go thru...where here‚Äôs what happens to me atleast....I constantly wonder if I even need to keep on with college because I doubt I‚Äôll make it to my PhD (but that‚Äôs just my anxiety talking), I always tend to say sorry even when it‚Äôs not my fault because it feels like everything is my fault. Some times I feel like everything is a dream and I‚Äôm just watching everything and everyone go thru with life behind a window. When I get anxiety attacks...I start feeling out of place as if no one wants me around which causing me to want to be alone so I go to my room or somewhere alone...then the shaking starts..an uncontrollable shaking.. then i can even feel the blood going thru my veins as I start hyperventilating. I swear I try to breathe but nothing works it feels like there‚Äôs no oxygen for me to breathe in....then at that point where I‚Äôm just sitting in the corner feeling horrible it gets worse...I start hearing (remembering) things that people would tell me. Whenever a mean coach would yell and tell me I sucked well that would come to mind...whenever my mom would yell at me call me stupid and that I won‚Äôt make it well that would come to mind...Everything. You just hear everything and it just all attacks you at once. Then you get a feeling inside you that you want to scream so loud but you can‚Äôt because you don‚Äôt want anyone else to hear. It‚Äôs all this until all you can do is lay on the ground and cry. Cry so much your head and eyes hurt.....And that everyone...is anxiety.

Sure they pay a lot more but at what cost? Their dishonest work discredits ours, degrades of degrees and hinders our quality of education. Most international student's don't even stay in the U.S after graduation to work and stimulate our economy. Most go back to China, Korea, India, Saudi Arabia--flaunt their U.S degrees, work in their home country, stimulate their economies, all the while us Americans take the hit.

- give it an epic dual-typing like Grass/Steel.  Yeah this make it 4x weak to fire but honestly almost anything with Grass makes it 4x weak to something (rock is good but honestly is lame)
- give it leech seed levelling up

Fire starter
- make it a quadraped mammal cuz nobody wants creativity they want more arcanines
- make it part normal cuz everyone hates fire/fighting cuz hurdur too many
- make a bipedal first form so when the design is initially released people will think it‚Äôs gonna be fire/fighting based on the tiniest detail
- make it blatantly not part of the chinese zodiac because people haven‚Äôt figured out that fennekin, a fox, is not a fucking dog and they still think this is a fucking thing

BUT ya‚Äôll can‚Äôt just be going all ‚Äúdon‚Äôt approach girls‚Äù and then bitch about ‚Äúwhy can‚Äôt I connect with anyone in rl‚Äù.

I am not the type to join orgs and clubs because I am simply not interested and even when I do go to ‚Äúevents‚Äù, guys rarely approach me. They do stare though, as if your glare is enough for me to wet my panties. It is not. I need an intellectual conversation, an emotional connection, and at least a dozen of solid jokes from you‚Ä¶then I‚Äôm all yours. I‚Äôm obviously joking btw, but low-key high-key feel free to print a pack of memes/jokes and give them to me if you see me in public. 

Now, I don‚Äôt have an issue getting matches and meeting people from tinder. I usually meet about 5 guys a month when I‚Äôm bored and want some ‚Äúmale attention‚Äù. I think it is a fucking great tool in 21st century because guys don‚Äôt have the balls anymore (or maybe just in Cali) and this page is a damn proof. I have nothing against the page per se (love it and love ya‚Äôll) BUT c‚Äômon we all fucking know the difference between being a creep and being a normal guy approaching someone. 

What I am saying is that there were a few posts about ‚Äúdo you girls wanna be approached more‚Äù and some comments were like ‚Äúnah, stay away dude‚Äù. WELL. As a subjectively relatively attractive female (according to tinder statistics and my friends), BY ALL FUCKING MEANS APPROACH. 

Approach people in your classes, people you sit next to, people in line for coffee. Ask to borrow pens, ask academic questions, ask for directions. Be creative. How? Honestly test the waters and try different neutral pick up lines . Say ‚Äúyou have a nice perfume‚Äù or ‚ÄúI like your shoes‚Äù while in line for a coffee or after a class. I usually compliment guys on their outfit because none of ya‚Äôll use nice cologne :( which is actually sad because male cologne is fucking bae‚Ä®‚Ä®

So yeah, if the reaction is positive (aka the girl doesn‚Äôt give you a death stare), proceed to ask for an ‚Äúadvice‚Äù. A question is all it takes. Asking for ‚Äúhelp‚Äù is like a solid strategy when you want to get something. You are giving the other person a sense of ‚Äúpower‚Äù over the situation‚Äî this applies to life in general. ‚ÄúBy the way, do you happen to know where the room/building/etc is?‚Äù. Be nice/smiley and bring ‚Äúpositive energy‚Äù. Don‚Äôt overdo it and come off ‚Äúneedy/clingy‚Äù though. The initiative should (ideally) come from a girl, because this would increase the chances of a successful contact exchange. 

What I am trying to say is that for me personally there is simply not enough OPPORTUNITY for interactions with guys around me, which is why I use tinder and enjoy it for literally ‚Äúmeting new people‚Äù. Like yeah, I‚Äôm probably (read: definitely) not gonna like it when a guy is clearly ‚Äúeyeing‚Äù me and has a ‚Äúthirsty‚Äù look (yes! some of you do) BUT, what I would greatly appreciate is a sense of ‚Äúcreating room for interaction‚Äù, where, if I want.. I can take the conversation further.

I am just fucking TIRED approaching guys on my own because I‚Äôm traditional that way, so what.

Anyways back to the main point, you assholes that save seats at Geisel computers for hours as people scramble to use a computer can go die. Is there a library policy that prevents people from doing that? I feel like there should be. Don't you dare be mad if I decide to take the spot you were trying to save, though.

That said, from the stories and experiences people have shared with me, I'd like to propose a project that will hopefully make this campus feel a little closer. I'd like to start a penpal network that allows students to exchange physical letters.

Ill be honest, where i come from doesn't have many black people. theres only latinx and Koreans. But lemme tell you my friends and I, both hispanic and asian... we both struggle lmao. 
We definitely face different types of discrimation, but its discrimination nonetheless. To me it seems like there are equal number of successful hispanic and korean business owners and equal number of hispanics and koreans who struggle. 
Let me tell you, most of my asian friends from back home have it WAY worse economically than some of my black and hispanic friends here. 
Take my own family for example. My mom had to work under the table for less than minimum wage for most of my life as a single mom until the Obama administration did all that shit for us which applies to both koreans and hispanics. The same can be said for almost all my asian friends back home. 
I feel all yall. Al lot of the asian friends i made in college come from pretty nice families compared to where i come from lol. But that doesnt mean were all rich. 
In fact, the poverty rate for asian americans is actually higher than the national average. 
I remember freshman year when we (both hispanic and korean) all met up during winter break, we laughed our asses off about how much we struggled in our childhood compared to our new peers since we had NO FUCKING IDEA how much we actually struggled LOL. 
I have a few asian friends from back home who are well off, but i also have a few hispanic friends back home who come from families just as well off. 
For both communities, majority of us came to the states on a visa. And for both, a few of us came illegally through the border. Idk if yall know, but in the 90s, quite a few koreans had to fly to argentina and then go to mexico and then finally LA. 

We are not a ""model minority"" I feel like that title hurts us more than it serves us.

To me, it makes absolutely no sense how forming an arbritrary agreement with one person prevents you from feeling attraction towards another. ***Your body does not ""know"" you agreed to be exclusive to someone, so being unable to form new romantic feelings towards another person makes absolutely no sense***. I think what's more likely is once someone is cuffed they spend majority of their time and social energy on that one person so other people do not seem attractive not because of choice, but because of the nature of relationships and the amount of time and social energy spent with one's S/O. Consider this: John and Jane are in a relationship with one another. Jane moves to another State for grad school. There she meets Brian, someone who is kind, attractive, funny, smart, definitely everything she wants in an S/O, and they start spending enormous amounts of time together. You're telling me that she wouldn't once consider having a relationship with him instead of John? Because of what? The ""forces of love""? I don't think so. Obviously that's an extreme scenario, but point is no, don't feel bad about feeling those feelings.

I didn't have a group of people who I made plans with, so I went alone, figuring I would see some of my friends. I run into a couple people from a club after a half hour of wandering and chill with them for a bit, keeping me busy. They eventually split apart and I bump into a buddy from another org, who says we should stick together. They're not the type of person who would get on me for being a bit of a downer, so I start to feel more comfortable. I eventually run into my bestie after Joji's set and we hang out for a bit, until I decided to go further into the crowd during Vince's set to jam. Didn't know anyone and it seemed like a lot of people were out of it or had little experience with rap shows, so I go back out to find my group. My last crush walks past me as I anxiously look around for my friend, giving a quick wave. This made me feel happy, but also kind of taken aback and the ""it was an awkward acknowledgement, they're not happy to see you"" thought quickly begins to run on repeat. I cry for a minute and come to the realization that my bestie probably dipped. I go into the mosh pit on a whim and wind up having a good time, elbow to the jaw notwithstanding. As I leave, the synagogue tragedy news is the first thing I see on my phone, immediately turning the high from the pit into a feeling of grief and resigned disgust (Jew in Trumpland here.) I get some food after not eating for seven hours and another crying fit comes on. I can tell that nobody is looking, so I just let it happen. I find a bit of relief and briefly chuckle about the fact that I'm crying while shoveling down fries. Within a few minutes, that chuckle turns into an ""oh fuck, this is where I'm at now"" realization. I get a ""u okay"" text from my dad, which he usually sends if I forget to respond to his messages for a bit. My phone battery is at 1%, so I don't respond, again. I get back to my apartment and sit on the couch, thinking nobody is home. I start to hear the sounds of puking a minute later and begin weeping profusely, running to my room. Saw some old friends later on that night and enjoyed myself, perking up my mood overall. I might have had another cry before I went to sleep, could have been a different night though. I generally feel like I'm on the outside looking in and SG proved to be no different, but I knew that would probably be the case going into it.

12632,2019-04-30 13:46:12,"Dear Obnoxiously Loud People in the Library and Study Areas at UCSD,

I write to you all to earnestly ask that you all be more respectful of your fellow students with whom you are sharing the area with. 

I understand that the library (the non-quiet area) and study areas are not quiet study zones so some talking is okay. I mean I do it too. But the noise level is just amazing loud - I can hear you all talking even though I have my noise cancelling headphones on.

I understand that some people are teaching and helping their friends with materials from class and that's totally cool. However, you're not the only ones using the area. 

Like I said before, these areas are a communal, shared areas so, though conversing is okay (especially near Audrey's) but can we all be a bit more considerate of others and talk quietly (remember from grade school ""indoor/library voices""?), not have loud conversations on the phone and keep the loud laughing and horse playing to a minimum? 

Now, you may say, ""If you don't like the noise, then go to the quiet areas upstairs"" or that these silence-longing students ought to study elsewhere but that just defeats the purpose of a library. Furthermore, the upper levels can be full and therefore not always possible.

This applies to the study rooms as well. They're called ""study rooms"" and not a ""lounge"" for a reason.

As an esteemed Berkeley student once said, ""Hey! Hey! Hey! This is library!"" (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHhy2Gk_xik for your reference for those who don't get the reference).

Again, please be courteous of your fellow students trying to study.

12729,2019-04-30 01:13:17,"No one cares. The thought that echoes in my mind every morning when I wake, when I brush my teeth, when I go to school, and until I drift into the emptiness at night. To realize that it‚Äôs no one‚Äôs responsibility to care is a heart shattering realization. To know that you‚Äôre falling deeper and deeper into a pit and know that any one of the people you‚Äôre falling past could reach out and pull you back into the safety of love, acceptance, and empathy. Maybe they don‚Äôt know you‚Äôre suffering. Maybe they‚Äôre not paying attention. Maybe they have their own problems to figure out. Maybe they realize how much of a burden it is to be your friend and it‚Äôs easier to avoid. Regardless of the reason, the truth is that you‚Äôre alone. Alone with your thoughts, alone with your feelings, alone with your cares and desires in this world. 

This sense of loneliness compounds with every glance at a kissing couple, friends laughing, etc. You ask yourself why other people have friends, have significant others, have love, acceptance, have fun, and the only rationale explanation is that you weren‚Äôt chosen. This feeling of being the last one picked, the odd one out, is something you‚Äôve become all too familiar with. From gym class and teams in middle school to projects in college, the polite ones glance down to avoid eye-contact or say, ‚ÄúUmmm, I‚Äôm actually already with x.‚Äù You realize pretty quickly that you‚Äôve been standing for too long, left out hanging. Your body squirms with the discomfort from the gaze of others. Your entire existence is skipped over until the silence of the second last person being picked and you slowly drag yourself over to the other team. Last picked alludes to some notion of being chosen when that couldn‚Äôt be further from the truth. You weren‚Äôt chosen. An unlucky team or person was stuck with you. You‚Äôre given to someone who doesn‚Äôt want you, like an ad placed in your mailbox or more adeptly a parking ticket stuck onto someone‚Äôs windshield. You didn‚Äôt choose this life of torment and yet it was likewise thrust upon you.

You ask yourself where did it all go wrong? How could you be born into this world like everyone else yet end up so different, so far from everyone else? Everyone‚Äôs origin story is different. Mine began in middle school. Before, I felt like I was just another kid for the most part. Things changed when I was evicted from my elementary school and forcibly placed into middle school. I was warned that the school might be a bad culture fit. Like the naive kid I was, I didn‚Äôt give it much thought. The message that I was unwanted was slowly bled into my mind. From the teachers to the students, it was made clear that no one wanted me there. I didn‚Äôt belong. I wasn‚Äôt white. I wasn‚Äôt rich. I didn‚Äôt play club sports. I didn‚Äôt wear Quick Silver, Hurley, or the stereotypical clothes from other students. A memory etched eternally in my mind is returning to class after lunch and since all the boys played outside, we were all sweaty and dirty. My eighth grade teacher greeted each of them with a smile but that smile quickly vanished when her eyes laid on me. ‚ÄúGo clean yourself up, you look absolutely disgusting‚Äù still echoes in my mind and the feeling of being lesser than are still branded in mind with a wound as fresh as the day those hot iron words struck my ears. This realization wasn‚Äôt something that happened overnight. It was like most things in this world, slow and steady. You begin as a flat grassy field with just a small trickle of disgust and disdain for your existence trickling through and before you know it, you‚Äôre left with a huge hole in your existence, a giant grand canyon of with thunderous waves of anxiety, depression, and self-loathing.

Time passes and the people around you change. You change schools and eventually leave to a different city for college. Your tormentors and peers long forget about you with you being a distant memory ever shrinking in their rear view mirror as they drive toward their rest, discovering the fruits of life, things that make things worth living, friends, love, and success. You cough as the dust spun up by the tires catches in your throat and eventually they fade from your view. But they‚Äôve left their mark upon you forever. What was outside and external, these thoughts of not being accepted, of being ugly, of not being good enough have slowly but surely seeped through the pores of your skin and now have corrupted your mind. They don‚Äôt need to be there to say it anymore because your mind already says it for them. You don‚Äôt need to hear the laughter from others when they make fun of your feelings on a crush, you now tell yourself, no, you know that you‚Äôre not good enough. Undeserving of love. Undeserving of affection. Undeserving of friendship. Filled with rage at yourself for being stupid enough to think that you could ever have those things you saw others enjoy. The hand of life slaps your childlike hands away from the candy at the supermarket checkout counter like a scolding mother. 

How many bad days does it take to change you a person? To corrupt what one was good, kind, and loving into something cynical? Maybe every rejection, every mean jab ever made, maybe every hurtful thing is like a stab to your heart until the skin scars and hardens. How many more days can you take before you decide it's preferable to die and kill yourself rather than go on another day locked inside of your mind, your life? What will be the final thing that breaks you so utterly and completely you lose all hope for life? Do you know what or when it will be or does it strike from nowhere? I know not the answers to these questions but am afraid I may find out the answer soon.

And while I might empathize both of these sentiments to some extent, what I really crave is someone who can provide something more enthralling than my solitude. I've experienced significant others with extreme love and depth. I've have friends with benefits. I've been in relationships lasting years that I thought I could share a life long companionship with. (I should say, I went to college late, and as such grad school late, so had the time to accumulate such experiences). Through all of this, the one take away is - that we learn about ourselves through others. Whether its as simple as learning about our romantic preferences, or learning the darkest parts of ourselves through the sordid experiences that only the depths of connecting with another human can inspire and teach.

I no longer wish for a passionate lust that leaves me insatiable daily, and not even a stable and sustainable love that might provide the comforting, complacent, but nurturing quality that becomes the norm in a long term relationship. I know myself, as much as one can, until we decipher more.

I just want someone whom I can share some of my vulnerable feelings and thoughts with (including the gravity of all the context and history behind it), and they can respond with ""I get it.""

I need a wake up call from my internet anonymous friends. 
So I've been in a long term relationship since HS to undergrad and now through masters. Since I am earning my masters in ucsd, the relationship became long distance.
Over the past year, as my girl has been working and traveling, our connection fell short. Her personality changed a bit mostly due to working environment, became a bit more commanding, type A stuff. Her interests shifted into photography, Instagram fame, tinder, thrill seeking... I mean, I know, tinder is already a red flag. I went clear with her about my opinions on dating applications, and she insists and promises that it is for sole usages to get followers(???). Idk man, don't ask me. Partly maybe just because she's lonely and in need of attention? Dude the logic is a mess, anyway, an exclusive simple relationship was my request. 
Anyhow, we had verbal arguments. I felt unloved and discarded. I realized how much has changed over the past year. I don't think I've changed much, video games, exercise, food, talking over phone, work grinding cycle seems fairly balanced to me. fuck im drifting away from topic. Knowing her past well, I can understand the reason for who she's become today. But at the same time, my unrequited love and affection had me in some agony. It felt like loving a stranger who you once knew, FeelsBadMaN.
After graduating, I will be heading back home for M.D. degree, which is a few states away from her. Asked her if she'd like to come back, she said she is content with current workplace so give her a year to make some savings. I feel that I am slowly losing grip of this relationship. Even if we keep on to have ourselves to be loyal to each other, we don't quite click anymore. It's hard to be exciting or flirty when your partner isn't in the mood. I don't remember what I was going to ask for in the first place. I'm just a bit sad and intoxicated. 

If you kindly may, gimme some inputs or suggestions on what to do.
Undoubtedly, I have a privileged and loving life which I am thankful for.  If a seven years relationship fails, ggs go next I guess, what can ya do, hell isn't breaking loose. Just all this sad boi thoughts had me in need of confessing. So I guess that makes you some type of internet confession booth Father, or Mommy? 

Anyways, pour me another.

12474,2019-04-29 11:13:56,"Smash Ultimate Stage Builder Guide

Alright so I've had around like 10 hours of experience with the new Smash Ultimate Stage Builder so I've decided to make a guide for people who are new and wanna try shit out so they don't have to spend the first few hours figuring everything out.

Basics
1) The Grid.  Press Y and check the grid near the bottom left.  It'll make keeping the stage symmetrical a million times easier.

2) Highlighting.  You can drag a square to select multiple objects at once which makes it possible to move things around at the same time.  

3) Layers.  There's 4 layers: back-background, background, stage, and foreground.  You can change one you're drawing in by pressing Y then selecting the layer you want.  

4) L button. Press the L button to draw a straight line if you're in free hand, a square if you're in rectangle mode, and a circle if you're in ellipse mode.

5) Undo button.  Instead of tapping the undo button on the top left every time you make a mistake, just press the left button on the D-pad.  Make it a habit.

Terrain
6) Bouncing rubber.  Bouncing rubber does not make you bounce or jump higher.  However falling objects do bounce off of it.

7) Lava. Lava is technically a terrain.  Keep this in mind in the future.

8) Falling objects.  You can select a block of terrain and it opens a menu that allows you to turn on gravity.  This means the block will fall instead of floating in the air like an actual stage. 

9) Circles.  Circular objects WILL roll on an incline if they fall on one.  

Hazards
9) Bomb/Explosive Blocks.  Bomb/explosive blocks do no damage.  Bomb blocks basically exist to active explosive blocks to create destructible terrain.

10) Hazards + Terrain.  The most important note in this guide: pretty much everything else is just buildup.  So, hazards such as cannons and bumpers are fixed on the map.  However if a hazard is attached to Terrain with Gravity turned on, then it  falls with the terrain.  So you can essentially create a falling bumper/cannon by attaching it to a small piece of terrain with the gravity turned on.  

Other
11) Switches.  Switches do not activate bomb/explosive blocks.  They work by activating/inactivating the gear attached to the terrain they are on. 

12) Gears + Gravity.  If you turned on the gravity for terrain to make a falling object but then attach a gear, that object becomes fixed in the air again.  So basically you can't create a turning object that falls.   

13) Save online stages.  Even though Nintendo bans ""inappropriate"" stages, people still post them.  If you see a good stage, save it before it gets taken down!

fast forward to the same shift. at work sometimes the pro staff there get to do workshops/presentations for students. at the end people who went get to do a review on the speaker. one student in their review went OFF on how ‚Äúunprofessional‚Äù and ‚Äúunengaged‚Äù my boss was during an activity. when i saw that scathing review and thought back to what my boss told me literally hours before, i wanted to laugh so hard. my boss is such a fucking hypocrite and all the criticism they gave me earlier that shift is so questionable now",,,,Mon,4.0,8.0,8.189999999999996,37.67399999999997,14.301000000000013,0.114,0.848,0.038,-0.9124,02

But in reality I just do not give a fuck about student leadership and professionalism the staff there always preaches. I see the entirety of the professional staff there as people who did not figure out what they wanted to do after college, so they decided to just work for university instead claiming a career in ‚ÄúStudent Advising‚Äù or ‚ÄúStudent Leadership‚Äù or some BS. I doubt any sane person ever went to undergrad and thought to themselves ‚ÄúI wish I had a major or career path that will literally never let me leave college ever again!‚Äù

I gotten to the point where I break so many rules and lie to all the staff all the time because the work is a load of crap and there‚Äôs literally no reason why not to break the rules if it means making my job easier (I also do it in spite of how dumb the rules are). I‚Äôm so numb to how much it‚Äôs actually affecting my job there, but I could care less because my coworkers also do not genuinely care about the students they serve half of the time anyways, despite it being in their job descriptions. The departments like mine claim to ‚Äúenhance the student experience‚Äù when half of the time you are degraded and treated like shit BECAUSE you are a dumb student.

It wasn‚Äôt always like this for me. I am a VP of a mid sized social/fun org and it‚Äôs so liberating to be grassroots and just put on events and build a small community. No managers that are breathing down your neck. No dumb policies to abide to. No working with people who don‚Äôt care. Just working with other students to bring a fun event. That‚Äôs the student leadership I live for and is why I initially thought this job I applied for would feel like. But when I have to do similar stuff for work, there‚Äôs no passion or emotion behind the projects and events my department puts on. Because it‚Äôs run by staff who need to fill an arbitrary quota and enforce stupid policies during the planning and executions of the event. And no matter how good or bad it goes they get a paycheck anyways.

Yes, that was a shitty move on my part.

And uh.. long story short Girlfriend #1 blocked me on everything and never talked to me again, which really I don't blame her for.

Skipping past all the emotional guilt/unhealthy coping mechanisms that persisted through 6 months of my next relationship, I still feel incredibly guilty. Looking back too, she tried to reach out to me multiple times after the breakup so we could connect and catch up, but I was always busy with school, and.. I just regret everything?

It's two years down the line, and I'm still finding myself dwelling on something that happened way in past, when I've already made my peace, and I don't really understand?

I just think back to how utterly shitty I made her feel, and how I completely cut off a wonderful person from my life forever because I was a dumbass who couldn't control his dick. We made plans before she left to meet up again, and how we were even going to be at eachothers' weddings, and I just ruined everything. Jesus man, that shit comes back to me at night sometimes and it really just fucks me up.

Is it ever really supposed to go away?

I've spent alot of time making my peace with it so I could fully love Girlfriend #2, and I thought I did, but after Breakup #2, that shit just pops out on quiet nights (during Joji too actually), and I don't really know what to do with myself?

I'm not simping after my ex, I just feel like an incredibly shitty person because of what I've done, and of an important person that I've lost.

I do believe sometimes you can't speak the truth to be considerate of the person, which depends on the environment and the concept which gets complicated. I just mean straight up lying about something here). My boyfriend, despite knowing how much I value the truth, has lied to me about something over the course of our entire relationship and only told me now after we've been dating for about 6 or 7 months. Almost a year since we've met. I did not know what to do when he told me and it was through text, the night before my midterm when I was studying. Because of this I ended up pulling an all-nighter trying to study while the shock was in my mind and ended up passing out at a commuter lounge. Besides all that, I made an exception and gave my boyfriend a second chance because I really love him. Now here's where things gets a little complicated. Since then, I've unintentionally started to emotionally abuse my boyfriend (i realized this, and he knows it too). By unintentionally, I stopped sharing things as much and did alot of things that were described on articles describing an emotionally abuse relationship and later realized that these are actually a part of an abusive relationship. Despite knowing that, my boyfriend decides to stay with me because he told me that he loves me. A part of me hated doing this because I know it is morally wrong, but the other part of me feels like  he deserved at least some of it because he knew how lying impacts me and how much I values the truth, but decides to lie anyways. I have multiple evidence of he telling me that he's never lied to me and never will, just to later on find out that he was lying making these lies as well. During the course of the ""emotional abuse"", he blames himself that this happened because he lied to me. Right now we've gotten to an agreement that we'll work through this together, but I'm honestly lost.

I say this because the friends I have now are people who I can relate to. One of them has to support themselves with two jobs because they are in poverty. Another one is a refugee from the middle east and a DACA recipient. I myself am also in a disadvantaged situation: hereditary neurodegenerative eye disease, and my family of five still lives in a 2-bedroom apartment.  

We don't take an Uber to go get boba and hot pot because we don't have 50 dollars to blow for a single night. None of us have the luxury to spend a Saturday night getting drunk and throwing up because we all work on Sundays. 

I am so thankful for these friends I have made. They understand me as I understand them. I don't have to pretend to not like boba anymore because I can't afford it. I don't have to order the least expensive thing at BJ's because holy shit I ain't paying 15 dollars for one fucking meal anymore. I don't have to go hang with friends anymore simply because I don't have money to pay for the booze anymore.

Instead, we find free events and share them with each other. We took advantage of the Sun God $5 lyft to go off campus to downtown. We made our own sandwiches for the day. We buy dining dollars for 2:1 ratio because it is such a bargain.

Truly blessed.

Have you ever met someone with major, obvious personality flaws and wonred how they got there? What kind of trauma or bullying did they go through? Why is their mindset so negative or angry, etc?

If you respond to someone saying they don‚Äôt like Californians by raving about how awesome California is and how much you love the beach and where you‚Äôre from, you totally missed the point. No one‚Äôs mad you like living here and don‚Äôt want to leave !!!! Nobody would argue that the weather and the beach and having cultural hubs like LA and SF is bad. That why we come here!! 
The problem is with the people who grow up here, have never left, and thus have no perspective about life outside of California. And I get not everybody has the means to travel, that‚Äôs understandable. But I have had too many people who grew up in the Bay or OC and never lived anywhere else spew opinions at me about why the rest of the country sucks and why people in the Midwest or South are bad. It‚Äôs nonsense. And people saying they have no desire to leave EVER kinda just show how little they care about the rest of the country, which is very stereotypical for you all.
Part of what drove me to go out of state for college was to live in a totally new place and be around people from different backgrounds and who have different experiences. So coming here and being met with a lot of Californians who have so many preconceived notions about the rest of the country and no desire to actually learn about them is INCREDIBLY disheartening. I‚Äôve lived in 4 different states in very different regions of the US and this is the first place I‚Äôve experienced anything like this.

We aren't out & about making fun of guy's height, we just have our own preferences and ideal types. At the end of the day, the person we end up having a romantic relationship with might not even be tall (as we ""imagined"") and it won't even matter as long as we love them for who they are. Yes, it's hard to grow, but it's also hard to lose weight. God created us all very differently, we literally come in different shapes and sizes, but that doesn't mean that all tall girls are bxtches and want to be with  a tall guy. Some girls prefer men who are the same height even shorter, there's nothing wrong about it. But societal norms are usually the guys are taller, if not, the same height as women. I dated two guys in the past who were both over 6ft. And recently crushed on a guy who's actually shorter than me, but we ended up being just good friend (not bc of his height) but b/c he's a freshman and I'm a senior & I don't swerve like that, LOL.

The people who give you shit and act like immature little brats don‚Äôt deserve to have you in their lives. 

I am beyond grateful to have you in my life, to know that you‚Äôre still there for me. You were one of the first friends I ever made on this campus, and I cherish every single memory that we‚Äôve made together, from playing at that playground in UTC at 10 PM to the look of joy on your face when you opened up all the gifts I gave you for your birthday last year to filming at the cliffs by Gliderport at sundown a couple of weeks ago. Every single joke, laugh, and smile that we have shared, I cherish and hold close to my heart. I know we don‚Äôt talk or see very much of each other anymore, but I do think of you and I do miss you. Whenever we do plan to meet up and see each other again, I look forward to it so much, that it‚Äôs like I‚Äôve turned into a giddy little kid again. And whenever we finally do meet, you make my day every single time. 

I know I‚Äôve given you shit in the past before and how that almost completely destroyed our friendship and the bond that we have, and I cannot tell you how sorry I am for having done that. But I will do as I have done for the past 7 months and demonstrate to you how much you mean to me. You make my world so much better and brighter and beautiful. You are such a wonderful human being and so goddamn beautiful inside and out, it fuckin‚Äô unreal. I don‚Äôt care what you say or what you believe about who you think you are and what you look like. You are so incredibly beautiful. Never let anyone tell you otherwise.

12347,2019-04-26 19:37:02,"With just days to go before my supply of jerky and nuts from home finally runs out, I recently went out on a hunt with my trusty rifle at my side and came across this most majestic goose. Had a bit of a gander and found that she was leading all of her little goslings around in a nearby lake. I suppose that indicated that she was the mother goose. However, I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to raise my rifle to secure sustenance for the next couple of days. It‚Äôs not because of all the goslings surrounding her. Truth of the matter is that, one day, we all have to leave our mothers and brothers and sisters to lead our own lives and worlds. Also, I need grub and ain‚Äôt gonna starve to death when there‚Äôs a source of fresh protein right there in front of me. But rather, it‚Äôs because I am afraid that I‚Äôll miss and all it will quite literally turn into a wild goose chase. 

You see, I‚Äôve never been a very good hunter or marksman. Never had anything to show for these hunts. Always aimed a bit too high or got a bit too close. I know a number of people who are excellent hunters and marksmen, who come back with sacks full of their kills. On the flip side, there are people like the British hunter I befriended, a man as calm and refined as Zaroff yet nowhere near as successful or murderous, as well as another gentleman from the former Raj whom I also befriended, another unsuccessful big game hunter who also hasn‚Äôt been particularly successful. We all give each other hunting tips despite being equally unsuccessful in the field. Don‚Äôt know how useful the tips we give each other are, but by God, the camaraderie we have between us almost makes all the pain from bad hunts worth it, and I thank the Lord everyday I have them in my life. I pray to our heavenly Father that one day, they will all get their big break and finally have something to show for their efforts.

So here I am, sitting in the cold dampness of my hunting lodge. Haven‚Äôt a fire going, haven‚Äôt found a need to get a fire going. No goose, no need for fire. But man, I am running out of food. If I don‚Äôt go out there again and at least try to get that goose before she and her goslings go away, then my goose will really be cooked (haha, the irony). Then I‚Äôll be left wondering if my situation could have ended up different and better, if starvation and failure was the only option, if I would have been successful. Well, I suppose I ought to quit acting like a silly goose myself. No more anxiety. No more delays. It‚Äôs time to shoot my shot.

When he whipped his small noodle out I was really disappointed it was so small. I tried to ride his dick, and I felt nothing at all. It was the most boring and uneventful sex I had ever had. I understand that a lot of asian guys are really smart and make a lot of money, but most of them unfortunately have a small penis which I cannot accept.

We would frequent the gym at similar times, and eventually started working out together. Big dude, large muscles, manly...your typical jock. Unsurprisingly, he was full of stories about all his hot-chick hookups (due to his inevitably attractive looks, you see). Most stories involved him going somewhere and having girls beg to be with him, multiple at a time, a real panty dropper you see. Well, one day, while finishing up a workout, he mentioned this party (gettogether) happening at his place later that night, suggesting I should go as it was ""bound to be full of ass"". I, being a grad student with nothing better to do on a Friday night, decided to go.  And yes, I must admit the place was full of people, men and women, but mostly chicks; the slutty-looking, cock-thristy kind, as he described them. Anyway, after many drinks, I ended up in what appeared to be a sex room; sparse groups of people performing some sort of sexual act. He was there, with a random chick. Honestly, it didn't feel uncomfortable (having gone through the ""wild"" stages of sexual exploration during undergrad, it seemed normal; or at least tolerable). What sorta was strange was being pulled aside by him to ""play"" with the chick accompanying him, which then turned into me fucking her. After some time, this jocky, manly, iron-pumping stallion of a panty dropper mentioned that ""since I was having so much fun pleasuring this girl, I should go ahead and pound him some"". Weird request, I must admit. But eh, I pounded his tight little asshole. It is rather interesting how impressions and stereotypical expectations work at times.

It is slowly hurting my self-esteem and makes me question myself. I am almost 21 years old and barely have relationship experience. I have had plenty of experiencing with small flings, causally dating, and to an extent, hooking up. But I just want to have a lover and best friend in one.

12222,2019-04-26 12:08:34,"Very unpopular opinion, especially among this group, but does anyone else feel like college is a borderline scam?

I graduated and am currently in the process of getting a job in EE. I‚Äôm not saying not going to college is the better option. Of course I wouldn‚Äôt be getting these interviews without my degree. Of course college opens up a lot of opportunities. 

But I don‚Äôt think college really made that much of a difference. Everything that I learned for this career could‚Äôve been learned in a few months. Definitely under a year, let alone 4+. 

There‚Äôs so much fluff in college. 2 years of essentially learning garbage that you went over in high school. Things that you‚Äôll never use or care about. And we fucking pay for it! Five thousand fucking dollars per quarter to go through this useless bullshit

And then upper division. Professors don‚Äôt care about the students. 90% of them anyway. They‚Äôre here for research, not to teach. Students end up learning mostly from textbooks or on their own. Then what the fuck is the point of taking a class of I‚Äôm Learning most of the content on my own?

I understand this will vary depending on the major. But it applies to me and many of my peers. 

I‚Äôve worked at internships before, alongside people making a very good amount of money. Many of them are in the six figure range that doesn‚Äôt start with a 1. None of them get as bombarded with work as my peers do. Academia can get extremely hard and stressful and I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs reasonable. It doesn‚Äôt reflect a real work environment. 

Again, I understand I‚Äôm basing this off my experience and that it will vary. But I would honestly be surprised if a large amount of work environments reflect the stress that students go through. 

Overall, college is an extremely inefficient way of preparing people for a career. There are absolutely better ways to do it. ",[redacted],rant,,Fri,9.0,11.0,60.276999999999894,29.539000000000062,43.926999999999914,0.103,0.815,0.081,-0.8245,12

12202,2019-04-26 04:59:56,"to #11721, after seeing your three posts and reading all the harsh comments from other people, I have to say that I can relate with you as a fellow Christian. I'm not a guy, but I also get slightly turned on when I see some attractive guys (face-wise or body-wise). Since I'm a girl, Idk if I would be labeled as a ""creep"" like you were. Yes, there is something immoral about such reactions, but that doesn't define us as creeps. I'd say that someone is a creep if they end up crossing boundaries, such as taking photos, stalking, verbally/physically harassing the person, etc. Hormones can be hard to control, especially in college.
In response to your predicament though, I'd say that you have to decide whether your spiritual life or physical life is more important. Of course, nothing seems to be going wrong for your friends who have sex, but that's only based off of your judgement. God is there to judge, so you only need to focus on yourself. What happens to other people isn't going to necessarily be the same for you. You might end up feeling extremely guilty if you have sex before marriage. You'll further distance yourself away from God as well. I'm a Christian, but I've had multiple sexual partners and I can't tell you how guilty I feel. I'm worried about how it affects my relationship with God. But then again, I also believe that He already knew I would have these sins. Under religious standards, sex is meant to be a gift that you enjoy with your special person. I personally support your sexual abstinence because it'll bring you greater rewards. If you do give in to that temptation, it'll be hard to control it afterwards. Just a fair warning. and of course, with any sin, you should try to repent for it. If you don't, you're kinda just disregarding His authority. Whatever happens, God has love for everyone, so don't feel burdened.
And to the non-religious people, I know you're extremely skeptical of Christianity, but Christianity, and any other religion, does provide meaning, guidance, and hope to people's lives. Religion isn't a scapegoat for one's shortcomings and it isn't an escape from reality. Some of us just care a lot about our spiritual lives and it's hard to decide whether we care about the spiritual or physical side of things. It isn't an easy task to disregard religion, so it makes sense why OP is having a hard time over this. Religion is just something we value and trust in a lot. Having a lot of trust in something usually leads to obedience. I know it sounds hypocritical of me to say that, but I'm still a growing Christian (fairly new to be honest) and I'm learning how to trust in God more so that I can be obedient. Practicing obedience also means that you have the patience for God's rewards. And these rewards may not necessarily manifest physically. I know that y'all don't agree, and that's totally fine. It's hard for Christians to fully agree with the Bible too. 
ANYWAYS, I don't want this to turn into a religious debate or whatever, I just couldn't silently read some of the comments on the original post.

""The confessions page is awesome because of some people, not. Pranay Mehta, your comments on attempting to descend to contemporary humor by ""aligning"" to societal norms, indeed is awesome. To portray yourself as a non-deviant, coy individual that is sophisticated and keeping with the trends, I must say is a really good effort. With your insightful comments on everything from Joey tribbiani's supposed orientation to making fun of people that talk about problems being sexually active and asking them to contact a locksmith, I must say that you have definitely raised creep flags as well as offended people over here. It is indeed ironical that you have called Asians cancer, while you are an Asian yourself, or is it?

Recently however I've kept a little notebook of things I can say instead of ""I want to die"", like ""I wish I didn't have to experience stress"", ""I don't want to do this work"", ""I want to sleep but I can't"", or ""I wish I didn't experience heartbreak, I want the pain to stop"". Because now I understand I don't actually want to die. Processing these feelings into things that are less defeating and all-encompassing makes my emotions more tangible. For the better, I stop spiraling into a depressive hole of wanting to die as my only solution. 

""I don't want to experience stress"", ""I wish I didn't read that"", ""I wish I understood this problem"", I can process properly. I can live, and live with these emotions. They're still sad emotions, but I can cry to myself saying these phrases instead of ""I want to die"" over and over.

unposted,2019-04-25 18:12:32,"First Scene is actually Hawkeye losing his family to the snap. He doesn‚Äôt actually see it happen as he is facing the other direction. We then get the Tony/Nebula sequence (paper football, etc). Tony records his message to Pepper. When he falls asleep, Nebula takes him to the front of the ship and sits him in the pilots seat. He wakes up and sees something glowing outside the window. Captain Marvel helps them return to Earth. Pepper, Rocket, Steve and Rhodey all come out to greet him. Tony is very shaken, particularly about losing Peter.

Movie starts with the Avengers trying to find Thanos. Steve wasn‚Äôt to know where Thanos is and asks Tony, but Tony says he doesn‚Äôt know, They argue. Nebula knows of Thanos‚Äô garden he said he would once go to when he completed his goal. They found him because of the energy he released using the gauntlet. Thanos is alone, and tells them he used the gauntlet to destroy the gems. He is weak and Thor, angry, decapitates him.

Title Card and five years later.

Natasha is now basically in charge of what's left of the Avengers is talking to them via holograms. Basically the world is in ruins and they're trying to salvage it. Carol is there via hologram with a new haircut and uniform and tells them that she's covering thousands of planets and won't be able to come back to Earth for a ""long time"".

Steve and Nat talk about how the Avengers are family. Inside a storage shed is Luis‚Äôs van. A rat is crawling over the Quantum controls and activated the switch which brings Scott out. He‚Äôs now locked inside the cage but starts waving at the security cameras. A guard lets him out and he is walking the streets confused as to why everything is so overgrown and run down. He finds a memorial which lists the names of the ‚Äòmissing‚Äô on large stones. He starts reading them panicking that Cassie might be listed on them. But she isn‚Äôt. He sees her at home, as an older version of herself. Scott drives to the Avengers facility and Nat and Steve let him in and he tells them about the Quantum realm and how they might be able to build a time machine to go back to the past before everything happened. They visit Tony, but he doesn‚Äôt want to help. He‚Äôs happy with the way that his life is, with Pepper and his daughter Morgan. They leave and to visit Bruce who is now Professor Hulk.

The plan becomes to start looking for the gems in the past. Initially Banner builds quantum time machine and sends Scott back to test but it is faulty, Tony refuses to help at this point, however, he returns Caps shield and they make up. He tweaks Banners Quantum Machine, The catch is that they need quantum particles for it to work.

Natasha goes to Japan to get Clint. He is mourning his family and is not certain of the plan. Rocket and Hulk go to get Thor who is drinking and playing video games with Korg and Meik. (Funny joke involving an online video game troll)

Finally the team then all suit up and discuss their plans to get the stones. They make it clear that they can not mess up because there is only enough Quantum particles for one trip for each of them.



Tony, Scott, Steve and Bruce go to the Battle of New York. Hulk meets the Ancient One at Dr Stranger's future home. Ancient One refuses to give the Time Stone to Bruce but relents when Bruce tells her that Dr Strange will give the stone to Thanos.

Cap, Iron Man and Scott tries to retrieve the Tessaract after Loki surrenders. SHIELD/Hydra agents Crossbones and that bald guy with glasses in Winter Soldier retrieve the brief case containing the Tessaract. Past Hulk funnily has to walk down lots of flights of stairs as he can't go on lift due to maximum capacity. Cap meets with Crossbones with the briefcase in elevator along with other Hydra agents. He convinces them to give him the briefcase containing the staff when he utters two words: Hail Hydra. Cap gets the briefcase. Tony in disguise as a SWAT soldier tells Scott to disable his past self's chest reactor to give him a minor seizure while his past self meets up with Alexander Pierce who demands the Mind Stone and Loki. Present Tony retrieves the briefcase but past Hulk accidentally knocks out Tony and Loki uses the confusion to teleport out with the Tessaract. Present Cap accidentally meets with his 2012 self, and 2012 self thinks he's Loki in disguise. They fought and 2012 has present self in chokehold when he tells his past self that Bucky is alive. He then taps his past self with staff to knock him out.

In Asgard, fat Thor and Rocket plans to retrieve the Aether out of Jane Foster's body. Thor's mother meets his 'son' and know he's from the future. Rocket retrieves the aether out of Jane by prodding her off screen and gets chased by guards. Before Thor leaves, he retrieves Mjolnir!

On Morag, War Machine and Nebula stays on Morag while Clint and Nat goes to Voromir via a ship that Rocket miniatures for Clint. Unknown to Nebula, her past self's nervous system and databanks are connected to each other and Thanos finds out where the stones are and how he meets his fate.

Cap and Tony transport back to 1970 at the SHIELD training site seen in Winter Soldier and goes underground to retrieve that era's Tessaract. Tony retrieves the Tesseract while meeting his dad. He calls himself Howard Potts. Cap makes a prank call to young Hank Pym and sneaks into his office to steal 4 vials of Pym Particles. Cap also sees Peggy. Cap and Tony teleport back to present.

WM and Nebula knocks out Quill during his dance in intro of GOTG. They got the stone and WM and Nebula was meant to teleport together but WM only succeeded. Present Nebula and past Nebula meets and fights and past Nebula takes her place to go back to present.

On Voromir, Clint and May meets the Red Skull as seen in Infinity War and is told how to retrieve the stone. Clint and Nat fought each other. Clint jumped off cliff but Nat catches him and held on by grappling rope. She falls off and dies like Gamora. Clint now has the Stone.

All members went back to present and everyone is devastated by Nat's death. Tony and Bruce constructs the Infinity Gauntlet and Thor wants to wield it but Hulk goes instead as he's the strongest one and the stones emit gamma radiation according to him. He wields it and snaps his fingers restoring all life lost. Clint's wife calls him on mobile. Hulk suffers extreme pain in his right arm due to IG. Past Nebula activates the Quantum teleporter and summons Thanos' warship and blasts the Avengers HQ to ruins with missiles.

Hulk lifting up rubble similar to Secret Wars cover where he lifts up a whole mountain except this is less in film lol.

Clint finds the gauntlet and is being chased by Outriders creatures in last film. He kills them and is met by past Nebula. Gamora and present Nebula meets up and Nebula kills her past self.

Cap, Tony and Thor teams up against Thanos. Thor is losing against Thanos even though he has Stormbreaker and Mjolnir. Thanos is about to kill Thor with SB when:

Cap lifts up Mjolnir and beats Thanos with hammer and shield.

Thanos uses his double blade weapon to break Cap's shield in half.

Thanos summons his whole army including the Black Order and some new creatures. Cap is all by himself against a whole army.

He hears Sam's voice and he turns around and see EVERYONE who has vanished PLUS huge armies of Wakandans, sorcerers and Asgardians (no signs of Warrior Three). Wong, Valkyrie, Wasp and Pepper Potts as Rescue turns up as well. Ant Man becomes Giant Man.

Clint plays American Football with IG and passes it to Black Panther then Spidey. Quill meets past Gamora and gets hit in the balls, not believing he is the one she loves lol. Scarlet Witch overpowers Thanos but Thanos orders missiles to hit everyone including his forces. Captain Marvel shows up to destroy Thanos' flagship and gets the IG and dashes towards the goal. There is a bit where Hope and Scott goes to the van with the Quantum teleporter in the middle of battlefield. Was lost in the moment so forgot why they doing that, sorry.

All female Marvel characters fight Thanos. Spidey's armoured suit goes autokill mode with the extra arms.

Thanos tries to take the gauntlet off Marvel by headbutting her but didn't phase her.

Thanos retrieves the gauntlet away from Stark and he snaps his fingers. Nothing happened. The stones went to Stark and before he snaps his fingers, he says 'I'm Iron Man'.

White flash of light.

All of Thanos' forces turn to dust including Thanos himself.

Tony dies from using the gauntlet. Everyone mourns.

The battle is won but at a cost.

Holographic Tony gives a message to everyone present including his daughter.

A wreath with Tony's chest reactor is laid to rest at the lake near Tony's hut.

Everyone is present including GOTG, Peter, Maria, Ross, Nick and Hank and Janet.

Thor, still fat designates Valkyrie as Queen of New Asgard in Tonnsberg. Thor is now travelling with GOTG to find Gamora and maybe more Asgardians. Quill and Thor are about to fight for leadership lol.

Scott, Cassie and Hope are together again. Wakanda is back with his King.

Cap goes on a mission to put back the stones and Mjolnir to their proper places. Hulk says to Sam and Buck that he should be back in 5 secs. He didn't. Sam sees a old man at a bench and it's Old Man Steve (who looks like Clint Eastwood now but less wrinkles and bit younger than he is lol). Steve has wedding ring and passes his shield to Sam. Sam is honoured.

Ending shows young Cap dancing with Peggy at their house. That's it.

Credits music is set to 1930s music then shows all cast members. The main cast is shown with their signatures on it.

There is NO post credit scenes which is a first for a MCU.

Stan Lee cameo is set in 1970s where he is shown in his 70s younger self driving a car with a woman, driving past a army base where Cap and Tony retrieves the Tesseract there.

It's so funny when guys have to justify their fkboi-ness by passing it off as iMmAtUrItY. just say that you never learned how to be a decent human being, and that your pathetically horny ass would much rather dick around with feelings that aren't yours to make yourself feel better abt how emotionally stunted you are, and GO.

""They're just immature and don't know what they want?"" Hell, a LOT of ppl don't know what they want in life, or from others, but they don't make it their mission statement to toy around with the ppl in their lives, or to use them.

""They could use meaningful friends"" no SHIT, dumbass, we all do. the already flimsy explanation of why fkbois are the way they are by blaming it on how s h i t t y their support system is bollocks. FUCK that noise, it's not our responsiblity to H E A L them or HELP THEM SEE THE LIGHT, the argument that these ppl don't have good friends is stupid as shit. Having a large, impersonal group of friends does not make you a piece of shit LMAOOOOO. trying to find excuses for your destructive behavior and lack of self-awareness DOES.

An actual hot take: guys who have to justify that they're Not Fuckbois.... ARE fuckbois.

Another one: softbois are Also fuckbois, y'all the same species, don't try to distinguish yourselves

Last one: hey *, u kno who u r-- if you're reading this, I am so sorry that you have to wallow in your own self-pity to make yourself feel better abt how you hurt the current person you're seeing. Stop acting like your guilt overpowers your girl's hurt after the bullshit you pulled on her. She doesn't have to comfort YOU on how you hurt HER during the time that YOU have to apologize. Either cuff her and give her what you told her you would, or I will. Step up, dude, you're not fucking special. 

and for the last guy **, you never learned, did you? Your current girlfriend doesn't know what you've been doing behind her back. And you know that, and I hope that eats you from the inside out. I hope it festers so much that all you can spit out is bile and poison and you'll be choking on your own mistakes so hard that no one will be able to hear your pathetic excuses. You had costume jewelry but now that you have sterling silver in your hands you still long for something that's cheap and easy. I feel so sorry for you. You never deserved this much.

This quarter has been really tough so far and I spent thirty hours doing homework for a class that has nothing to do with my major this last week. Yes, thirty hours of homework for one class, in one week. I also have a part time job and three other classes, also not related to my major, because of the requirements I have to fulfill. What if I don‚Äôt pass all my classes this quarter and don‚Äôt graduate like I‚Äôm supposed to? That will only make things worse. I‚Äôm only in school because I feel like I have no other option, and don‚Äôt want to be without the safety net a degree provides.

I have a friend who has been increasingly rude to me, and even though I try to be kind in return, they always say ""well that's unusual, you're always so mean to me"". Honestly, I don't know if I have a right to be upset, because it's natural for people joke around a lot. It's just that I don't feel like we're that close, and I don't insult them back. It's also confusing because they occasionally do nice things for me (such as share notes or get food together), but then for the next few days they make a big deal about how nice they are.
They've said things like ""are you so dumb that you have to take notes about XXX topic?"", ""Shut up and buy me food"", and ""Why'd you sit in my seat, you ruin everything."" In class, they'll use my desk as personal storage for their items, talk frequently, poke me/grab my hand while I'm writing, write on my notebook, and physically take away my notebook. It's pretty distracting because I'm already struggling in that class, and I just want to get a decent grade. I don't do any of these things back to them, and I've told them several times variations of ""please don't touch my stuff"" or ""why can't you use your own desk?"" I've tried to keep it light, but I honestly can't take it anymore. 
Sorry if I'm being oversensitive, I just needed to get that out there. If anyone has any advice, it would be appreciated :) I know I should probably get more confidence and just straight up tell them that I don't like how they're treating me. Unfortunately, I can't just ignore them because we'll be in class for the rest of the quarter and we share a couple outside commitments (orgs, etc) that I value too much to quit.

Teagan commented that it has to do with my insecurities and that I feel like I can't be 100% myself with him and breaking up with him won't solve the issue if I get into a relationship again. And you know what? You're right. I'm a big fat goofball with my friends because I don't care how they see me--they're my friends and we unconditionally love each other. But with him, he is absolutely everything I could ask for, and the stakes feel higher, which is why it has been harder for me to completely wind down and be comfortable being the goofy, fun, dumbass that I am.  We are steadily getting better over time, and I was just having a moment of weakness and impatience with the fact that we aren't there yet. I already know it's up to me to work on me, but he holds my hand through it all and I couldn't bear not having him in my life. I love him. I'm in love with him.

So there‚Äôs this girl that I‚Äôve been talking to for the past couple weeks. We met up to study together a couple times (just us) and ended up spending most of the time talking. Everything about our interactions is totally natural and I feel like there‚Äôs a genuinely strong connection going on compared to other interactions I have had with other girls, even some of my guy friends. 

We are talking pretty much everyday whether it be in person or over text, and conversations can go on for 3+ hours. I‚Äôm starting to really like this girl bc we have a lot in common, but I don‚Äôt wanna ask her out on a date yet since I don‚Äôt wanna risk hurting our friendship.

Here are the signs I picked up on. + means a sign that I think means she‚Äôs interested, - means a sign that makes me think that I‚Äôm in the friendzone:

+/- she‚Äôs told me multiple times how she wants to get to know me better, and how she wants me to get to know her better
+ we‚Äôve talked about relationships in general and how we want something serious in our relationship
- she briefly mentioned a Tinder guy the first and second time we met up. Apparently they‚Äôre no longer talking
- she talked about her ex the first time we hung out
+(?) she told me she deleted Tinder (not for me I don‚Äôt think)
+/- she told me I should go on Tinder cause I‚Äôm a funny and good looking dude
+ she asked if I wanted food once, then delivered it to me
+/- she trusts me enough to talk about some mildly serious stuff
+(?) I can consistently make her genuinely laugh
+/- I‚Äôm not the one starting all conversations, nor are they one-sided

However that is why when your depressed ass is talking to itself, you gotta turn that shit upside down and literally tell yourself you believe in yourself multiple times even if it gets repetitive. If you keep on believing in yourself, at least in my experience, you will gain motivation again to do the work your depressed ass had no motivation to do before and procrastinated on. So instead of thinking about that crush, or friend that never messaged you back, or takes forever to respond and doesn't seem to give you back the attention you give them and you're sad about that, drop that shit. Throw your mind into a new path in believing yourself first. You have nothing to prove to others, you just need to prove to yourself first with self confidence in getting shit done.
Sincerely, op from #11440, the crushes ain't shit op, yes they still ain't shit either. Self motivate yourself with positive thoughts and tell your depressed ass you can do it. I know you can.

Spent almost 30 hours on one homework assignment for this week. They had to extend the deadline twice and I went to three office hour sessions and barely understood the material in the end. Thankfully I'm done with that now but I literally have lab tomorrow where we're getting our next assignment which is due Monday. It apparently used to be easy but now we use a program called Snap made by people at UC Berkley. The program glitches a lot and has to be restarted all the time.

""Someones got a bad case of triton eye""
Oof. Maybe, but I do think that it's overplayed and that there are genuinely some very attractive girls here.

‚ÄúReligious reasons‚Äù
""It likely means they're ugly and lack the social skills needed to pursue in this case women. Religion in this context is nothing more than a scapegoat for OP's own shortcomings""

Dang. I thought this place was supposed to be nice. This comment is low-key hurtful but I'll address it nonetheless.

I have platonic relationships with both sexes, and have had flirtatious relationships with girls in the past, so no, I don't lack the social skills to talk to women. I'm also not particularly ugly going by what others have said. How exactly is religion a scapegoat for my shortcomings? What exactly are my shortcomings in this case? No, my being abstinent is not because I am ugly or because I cannot talk to females (which I don't think is an actual issue that people have because females are just‚Ä¶people.) Rude and baseless comment though. 

""I dunno OP, you tell us. Why do you choose to stay abstinent? Is it worth it? You know, give us some more deets.""

Very valid question. I believe sex within marriage is the only place where it is acceptable as it is a mirror of Christ being the groom to the bride who is the church. Practically, the reason is that it avoids the pitfalls of hookup culture. I've been told all my life that I should be abstinent because of the aforementioned reasons, but in college, I'm now surrounded by people who constantly have extramarital sex and, well, nothing seems to be going wrong for them. So the predicament I'm in is that I'm questioning why exactly I'm doing this if everyone else isn't and they are fine. That's basically what I'm internally struggling with. I don't know if it's worth it or not. 

""Don't mean to offend, I was also raised Christian. But maybe you should stop believing that god cares about when or who you fuck.""

No offense taken, this is a relatively mild comment. This just gets down to your presuppositions of life and what is moral so I can't really remediate this here. Just different views. I believe He does, you believe he doesn't.

11774,2019-04-22 21:32:03,"This is in response to confession #11625 where OP wanted Asian Americans to ""acknowledge our privilege."" I understand where you're coming from. I understand that the Asian community has a long ways to go to work on our anti-blackness (this for real is an issue, especially among older generations, so please @ my fellow asian americans help your parents, grandparents, etc. to understand!!). And I get that some people may perceive that systematic racism does not affect us as much as others, which, in some cases, is true.
But, here's the thing:
""Asian"" is such a diverse term. When you say Asian, do you mean Laotian, Indian, Viet, Filipino, Chinese, etc.? Do you understand the difference in socioeconomic standing between south, southeast, east, and west asians? Why would you lump all of us into one group? Do you know what it's like to have your fellow POC not see you as a POC but for white people to still hold you beneath them because of some stupid model minority myth?
Your perception of the Asian American community is only a fraction of our reality. Many of us have immigrant parents, who fled war or poverty, to come here (my dad left vietnam on a boat by himself when he was only 15). A lot of us have parents who can't speak english, parents who need you to translate things for them when you go out to the market, parents who don't know anything about college, so you have to figure it all out on your own, parents who don't get hired because their english is ""bad"". A lot of southeast asian americans work low income jobs: nail salon techs, supermarket employees, etc. It's demanding, tough work, and people don't respect them, just look at how often people mock nail techs.
What you see about Asian Americans is only what the media portrays, what is barely skimmed over in American history books.
You say you aren't going to deny that Asian Americans have faced discrimination historically, but you only mention dog-eating jokes and the fetish around Asian women, so I hope you also recognize that the historical discrimination of Asians goes beyond that. Chinese Americans were laborers who worked on the railroads in America in terrible conditions. Japanese American citizens were forced into internment camps during WWII bc white people thought they were ""spies"". Vietnamese Americans lived with 3 or more families in a home after fleeing the war. And even today, Asian Americans face discrimination that goes beyond some dog jokes: Southeast Asian gang members from the 70s/80s face deportation threats today: Trump is pushing for the deportation of Vietnamese Americans ""with a criminal record"" who came here before 1995, even if the crime they committed happened when they were teenage gang members in the 70s/80s, and so, so much more.
But this isn't the oppression olympics. We shouldn't fight over who had it worse, but instead, recognize that each POC group has faced and continues to face their own struggle here in America. If we want justice, we have to stick and fight together.
We have to realize the faults we've had to each other and work to improve our communities instead of tearing each other down. I can't speak for other POC groups, but as Asian Americans, this means we need to realize that our community is historically anti-black, don't fucking use the n-word because it's ""cool"", educate yourself and your family and friends, make our community better--not bitter.
And to the OP of the mentioned post, I hope this was somewhat informational, and I hope you can understand how your generalizations of the Asian American community has hurt a lot of people.",,serious,,Mon,13.0,23.0,129.88800000000052,73.65599999999999,58.01399999999988,0.128,0.792,0.08,-0.9897,21

Your post on how Asian Americans only feel discrimination in the form of things like jokes PROVES you have no grasp on history at all and is just dumb in fucking general as you essentially preach fucking more tolerance for African Americans and Latinix people then write a horribly intolerant post. I'm a member of Nikkei Student Union, the Japanese American club on campus, and when I was told many people didn't really know about Japanese internment I didn't believe them but obviously it's true. So here's a little education for you:
Japanese internment camps was a knee jerk reaction of fear and racism. After Pearl Harbor was bombed by the Japanese, many Americans started to have this logic, if you're Japanese you must be a spy. So President Franklin D. Roosevelt himself signed executive order 9066. Where 120,000 Japanese people were sent to concentration camps in the US for two and a half years corcing them to leave their lives and belongings behind. Keep in mind roughly 80,000 of these people were CITIZENS OF THE UNITED STATES and the US betrayed them and said, ""No you guys are second class citizens"". On top of that martial law was enacted in Hawaii to specifically target Japanese who lived there. The FBI went door to door questioning people, and my great grandmother had TO BURN her only picture of her nephew because he was dressed in Japanese military garb because they would think she was a spy. Remember around ww2 pictures weren't that easy of a commodity to come by too.
Anyways even after internment ended things didn't get magically better because when japanese came back all their old belongings were gone and they literally had to start life over. Then you know what they got in return for the civil rights atrocity? Fucking $20,000. Because that somehow makes up for two years of being wrongly imprisoned and losing everyhton you have. Then it seems people like you seem to forget/ignore this horrible atrocity. Which shows another thing about Asian discrimination you completely ignore. We are fucking forgotten. When you hear someone make a racist joke about African Americans, I'm sure you're horrified, but when you hear one about Asian people, I will bet money you laugh your head off.
There is so much you don't understand and this long ass post doesn't even begin to fully cover it.

That doesn't change the fact that I'm in love with a boy and have the sweetest relationship right now, because we don't put an emphasis on sex. If sex is a really big part of what you want, then it requires more talking, but romantic feelings can go a long way.

Sexuality is complicated, and hard to define even with all the labels we have. Romance and sex can be different.

She's a really cool person. And I never had any sort of romantic feelings for her and the thought of it sickens me, because she has a boyfriend (who is also my friend) who I genuinely think is the best guy for her. The problem is that, for some god-forsaken reason, I get really attracted to her every time we talk for an extended period of time, and I hate it. There's just something about her that turns me on so much, it's not just her looks, it's everything about her, even the way she makes eye contact with me is both intimidating but also inexplicably turns me on. The fact that she mentioned that she's a dom in one of our conversations also doesn't help either. I know for a fact that she doesn't do this on purpose, and I also don't intend to act on these feelings ever. I just want to find a way to stop feeling overwhelmingly aroused every time I talk to her. It's genuinely distracting and makes me act like a bumbling fool when she's with me. I still want to talk to her just because our conversations are always interesting, but how do I keep myself from feeling this? I genuinely want to keep talking to her, not because of my attraction, but because our conversations are truly enjoyable without the whole attraction thing. It's just something about the way she carries herself, that makes me both scared and attracted to her. It's so weird. I'm not a small guy and I'm barely fazed by anything, but somehow this 5¬¥3 girl makes me act like an absolute idiot by just looking at me.

My roommate and I rarely stay in at home to eat, since we're busy with classes, work, dance practice and clubs, and tend to eat with our friends when we all have time to see each other and hang out. 

When we do have the time to come back and decide to go into the kitchen, it's a mess! The stove top is littered with food spills and random pieces of food under the burners. The counters are almost always dirty too, sometimes with liquids left on the counter, and definitely dirty and used dishes and cooking supplies. The left sink doesn't have the option to dispose of food, but more often than not, there's been food stuffed down the drain. The cabinets above the sink are taken up by a single pot and maybe a box of zip-lock bags, but otherwise aren't housing their dishes and cups, which are always sitting in the dish rack next to the sink at all times until they use them and fill the sink instead.

The dining table is stacked with crumbs, trash and study material; the couches are scattered with more backpacks and even a wax machine, along with wii controllers and candy bags from our college events. There's even trash and even more crumbs on the floor too!

Probably the worst is that when they go shop for groceries, because when they come back, the fridge and freezer is stacked with their food, and leave my roommate and I half a shelf on the door, and less than half of the top rack in the fridge. The freezer is always stuffed to max capacity too. So when my roommate and I go grocery shopping, we have to organize with what little space we were given, if any.

I'm just so tired of coming back and seeing such a mess, one time I cleaned the whole downstairs area, and not even a day later, it's back to looking like a tornado hit the apartment.

Luckily, I do still have a small handful of friends that have stayed beside me (""something, something... a few close friends are better than more superficial ones""). And through them, I know what it feels like to have real friendships: people who I don't feel insecure about reaching out to and people who make my smile last for days. I LOVE the people who I get to hang out with today, they're so damn amazing!

But regardless, seeing/remembering the friends I've lost hurts me. I miss these friendships and figuratively wanna write a ""Thank you"" note to each and every one of them (even the ones that ended in conflict). I hope my past friends realize I do miss them and wish them the best in life, no matter how we faded away :<",,"serious, sad",,Sun,10.0,15.0,26.950000000000035,20.020000000000014,12.089,0.222,0.553,0.225,0.6213,14

Their parents are sometimes outside with them but they don't seem to care that they are being so loud. What should I do about it? I don't really know which house these kids live in so I can't really approach their parents and the adults are only around sometimes while the kids are playing. Can I file a noise complaint online?

I'm an international student and I want to put this out there because as much as most Americans know what to do in these situations given recent events, many internationals don't because we haven't been exposed to this or taught how to do this. I also don't wanna assume all americans know what to do in one of these events, so this is just a general post to anyone who wants to feel more informed. I've gotten this info from research i've done myself, and most of my sources agree on the same things.

1. AVOID - if you hear something that sounds like gunshots, don't hesitate or wait around for other people to act. Take action and protect yourself - if there is no risk in the way, GET OUT OF THE ZONE AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. Notify others, or take others with you. Always know your exits, wherever you are. LEAVE EVERYTHING. You may want to text your family saying you're ok, but reality is you're not gonna be ok until you're off the shooter's range. Once you're outside and safe, call people - police, 911, family members, friends, etc. Prevent people from entering the area. 

2. DENY - If you can't exit the area, you must find a place you're gonna take shelter and deny the shooter. Eg. if shooter is in the hallway and you're inside a classroom, EVERYONE must act quickly and block the door with as many things as possible- chairs, tables, you can even get creative and use stuff like belts, books, or everyone's backpacks. Do so and then find shelter inside the classroom, stay away from the door as the shooter might start shooting through the door. Turn off all lights, stay away from doors and windows to avoid being seen. Your job here is to make it difficult for the shooter to catch targets. Remain quiet, put your phones in silent mode. You might be hiding but be prepared to fight should the shooter enter the room. 

3. DEFEND - If you are unable to exit or prevent the shooter entry to where you are, this is your last resort. Think of this: he's one shooter with a gun, but you are probably a lecture hall of 100+ students. Be committed to fight back. If one person fights back, the shooter will probably take him down. If 20 people fight back, say by throwing stuff, he stands less of a chance. You can throw furniture, books, tables, laptops, maybe you create a distraction plan while waiting for him to come. Your goal is to disarm and take down the shooter. If you manage to disarm him, DON'T KEEP HOLDING THE GUN. Throw it across the room if you can. Police will come in looking for the person with the gun, you don't wanna be arrested when you in fact disarmed the shooter. The more the people who fight back, the greater the change of survival. Of course 300 people throwing books at one guy could get messy, but everyone can do something, plan something out if you have the time. The shooter is not expecting anyone to fight back, let alone a whole class of students. Use this to your advantage and catch him off guard. Also, be loud and aggressive. Might sound stupid, but it could intimidate the shooter if a class of 100+ people come at him all at once. 

Feel free to add anything else, this is obviously not the only way to survive, and none of these will ensure 100% survival from a shooting, but it increases your chances. Remember, in any emergency situation, the faster you act the higher the chance of surviving you have. Don't hesitate. This could happen at any moment, and I feel everyone should be aware and know what to expect and what to do. If possible don't leave this in the confessions page, share this info around, if something ever happens we might be able to save a lot more lives.

Naturally, I got really bad junioritis and joined almost everything at my high school. I managed to survive with only one anxiety attack and only moderate burnout come May.

I get anxiety over saying no to things and will work myself to a break down to remain constantly busy. Obviously that‚Äôs not healthy or sustainable. I‚Äôve let go a few of my extracurriculars in college in order to make time for classes.

Hopefully I can adjust to this transition without wanting to actually die in order to maintain a workload I can actually handle and spend time doing not important but very fun things with people I don‚Äôt get to see enough.

So I wanted to share my life story to you, so actually today, I'm starting to think that I'm depressed why? Because I cry 3 times to 5 times every week, I sometimes plan to commit suicide but I just can't do it, and I also skip breakfast, lunch and sometimes even dinner, yes I have friends, they asked me if I had ate breakfast or lunch I just simply give them my fake smile and tell them that I already ate, I don't know why I'm lying to them but I just did, actually I'm a rebelious child I speak back to my parents, I don't listen to them and sometimes I even wished they were dead by now but....I just said those because I'm angry at them.

At school I'm popular for being the school dancer and I was also known as the Rebelious Teenager, I own that tittle because, I yelled at my teacher and even course her I was almost suspended but the principle gave me another shot.

It‚Äôs happened to me in high school with my ex-bestfriend and now my roommate. Both of them share the same personality that can be summed up as: super insecure so they attack/size up those they view as ‚Äúthreats‚Äù or superior. Basically big Napoleon complexes. Now I don‚Äôt particularly think I‚Äôm superior than others nor am I conceited, but I am aware I was blessed with certain things. I‚Äôm tired of my roommate constantly attacking me for things I work hard for.

In comparison to my roommate I am skinnier (she‚Äôs extremely insecure about herself being overweight), taller, in a happy relationship, have a higher GPA, and I guess prettier by societal standards. Everything besides height I work towards. I wake up at 6AM to work out and spend most of my time studying. She on the other hand sleeps until 1pm and plays video games all the time. Yet she has the audacity to complain about being fat when she has all the time in the world to work on herself. I offered to go to the gym with her and she refuses like what the heck?? 

I‚Äôm so sick of her constant complaining and bullying. However, I don‚Äôt think we are able to sit down and talk because I know she won‚Äôt listen, especially if I take charge. If I do anything that‚Äôs leadership-like she immediately dejects me. I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore, how come I‚Äôm getting attacked for being good to myself smh.

TL;DR My roommate is jealous of traits I work hard towards and attacks me for being superior. What should I do?

It was one day where I went out with my friends and I had to bus home. The bus doesn't stop right outside my door so I have to walk home. I wasn't feeling much until the last hill before my house. I really had to shit and I was 2 blocks away from home. I stood there with my legs crossed, clenching my butthole as tight as I can and slowly shuffling my feet so I can get home in time before I shit my pants. It feeling went away so I began to walk normally then it hit me all of a sudden and when I tried to clench my butthole for a second time, I was too late and I shat myself. I gave up and sprinted home and went straight to the bathroom. I ended up throwing away my boxer briefs and I got shit over my white H&M pants that I bought recently. This is only once instance where I shat myself. There's been too many instances where I shat myself during my last two years of high school (mostly junior year). 
This happened in my junior year of high school. All in all, I think it was worth shitting my pants for almost two weeks because I got shredded for a competition.

So she and I have taken several classes together (and may very probably be taking more in future), plus we have worked and are also currently working together in larger groups on academic and/or outside-the-class projects for over a year now. We've also been chatting and texting each other a lot about a variety of academic and non-academic things. 

Here's my confusions with the ""shooting your shot"":

I don't know how she'll react if I ""shoot my shot"", especially considering that we've been working together for a while and I don't wanna jeopardize my work. Even if I ""confess feelings"" for her, I don't know what to do next: a relationship, keep things as it is, or something else .. ? I am relatively flexible with where she wants to take things, but I also think that both of us are extremely busy people and may not have the time to take things forward either. I guess, I just want to let her know that she's perfect, while being almost completely okay with keeping things almost the same as right now. I won't be able to see her (only texting at the most) during the summer. Idk how to flirt or anything and don't even intend to do it that much; haven't even asked out anyone before. Would still like to be atleast a great friend, though. To make matters even more complicated, she's an Indian American but I am an Indian (*cough* social and cultural constraints on both sides actually)

Hard to totally ignore as the feeling fluctuates. Also been trying hard to look for social cues from her, but it seems pretty mixed-up imo. Unable to share this with anyone either. Been thinking for several months to make this post and been thinking for even more time to talk to her about this. Could probably just still keep everything bottled-up inside me (as I have for almost a year now) and just be thankful that amazing people like her are a part of my life in the first place, but Idk if thats the best option to choose either.

11515,2019-04-18 16:01:52,"OP of 11370 here. For reference that was the one about there girl who had sex with me and didn't tell me she has herpes. The comments I've read on that post were a bit concerning to me and I would like to address them. I'd do it under my account but no need to draw negative attention to myself.

1) I think we can all agree that she should have disclosed her status to me. If you disagree then go take a hike.

2) To Page Groeling: I am very much aware that herpes does not place my life in danger. However it is still a non lethal threat. I don't want to deal with rashes or cold sores if I can easily avoid it. To clarify I meant I was placed in danger of unnecessarily contracting a life long discomfort. Yes, there are treatments to make it easier to deal with. Why should I have to subject myself to that because of some asshole I barely know?

3) To Isaac Jiali Bi and those who were out to provide education: I'll review some of the statistics given by you all. ""Herpes is extremely common, 67% of adults have it globally."" ""~90% of people have type 1 and/or type 2"" ""About one in eight people ages 14-49 in the United States have genital HSV-2 infection."" ""1 in 5 men have it and 1 in 4 women have it."" 

Although I appreciate your attempts to provide education literally none of you agree with each other on statistics.

Furthermore how are these statistics supposed to help me? My case is a very specific situation where my partner has a 100% chance of having type 1 herpes that spread to her vagina.

4) If made aware of my partner's status earlier would I have had sex with her? No. The  comments shaming me for this decision are uncalled for. We live in a society where we are trying to move towards women feeling comfortable rejecting sex in any situation possible and having their partner being okay with this. I'm in full support of this mindset. As such I also deserve the right to only consent to sexual situations I am comfortable with. Some people may have the preference to have sex with someone who is knowingly positive for herpes. I choose differently. This is not a decision that is up for debate because a decision to withhold consent is not debatable.

5) To Travis Gilbert and –ò–¥–∞ –•–∞—á–∞—Ç—É—Ä—è–Ω—Ü: You two voiced many of my thoughts and feelings on this. I completely agree with everything you said. Thank you for standing up for me.

6) The fact that I feel I need to defend myself not wanting to contract and deal with an STD is outrageous. Is it possible and normal to live a healthy life with herpes? Yes. But who the hell actually wants herpes? The real issue here is that I had a shitty and untrustworthy partner and somehow my views on consent and acceptance are being questioned. I'm the victim here.

Still, they haven't deleted/unfollowed me, they're usually in the seen list on my stories (could just be a result of a skip showing as seen), and our common friends are not treating me any differently. We're both graduating in two months and the odds of us speaking to each other again after that are not even minuscule. For me, the thought of that fateful finals week marking the end of us knowing each other hurts, but that's probably just because I'm not jaded enough yet. I know that it's a bit selfish of me to see if we're still cool by going with a ""how's your quarter going"" message or just being honest about the thought I mentioned, but I'm considering it. I have gotten so used to letting things go unresolved because of being scared and taking the initiative to possibly get one last bit of closure might be a good step for me.

11382,2019-04-18 02:54:33,"Hi, #11188 (splitting utility costs). In my opinion, you should pay less than your roommates for utilities, but still pay the same price for rent. Simply because if you didn‚Äôt use it then you shouldn‚Äôt need to pay for it. Given that you only spend 12 days in a month in the apartment, it‚Äôs definitely a huge difference compared to your roommates who spend 30 days at the apartment.

I didn‚Äôt charge them for water/electricity for those 7 days even if ‚Äúit‚Äôs not my fault they went back home.‚Äù Even if that was only  ~$10 discount, I still did what was right, which is to only charge them for what they actually used.

I tried so damn hard every single quarter. I put in energy into the people that I thought might actually work out to be friends.

I'm used to having hangouts called off cause they're ""too busy,"" and then seeing them hanging out with their friends on snapchat... friends that don't include me. I reschedule, reschedule, keep rescheduling and they don't even try to reschedule. I'm always the one reaching out, always the one trying to ask how was their day. I listened and laughed with them when they were struggling and cried alone when it came to my own struggles. 

You all claimed that maybe it's my fault, that I don't try hard enough, that I don't open up enough. It's always my fault. My fault. My fault.

Maybe you're right. I know I'm not the best of people. I know that I have my quirks. I know that I sometimes say the wrong things. I know I'm not cool, pretty, smart, funny.

It‚Äôs happened to me with my ex-best friend in highschool and now with my roommate. Basically the two have the same personality: to put others down if they feel like they are inferior to them.

Compared to my roommate I am skinny (she‚Äôs really conscious about herself being overweight), taller (she pretty much has a Napoleon complex), in a happy relationship (she‚Äôs had a history of bad ones), have a higher GPA, and I guess prettier if we are basing off of society‚Äôs views of physical beauty.

Some of them have better GPAs, some of them are in great relationships, some of them are leaders in student orgs, and so on.

I mean I won't blame them for not caring about a trash guy like me, and honestly it would be better if I just disappeared. There's also the issue of them telling to do this and do that, you know, the positivity and exploration argument that everyone's heard of, but they just don't work on a person like me who doesn't have the motivation for any of that. They ask me what I stand out in, but isn't that a stupid question when you just know in your heart that you don't have anything to stand out in because you're literally at the bottom of the society? I'm tired of them always saying the same thing, while at the same time I know they're tired of saying those things to me knowing that I won't get it. Yes I really don't get these advice, because we're not in the same social status. They are of heaven, and I am of hell.

I think an apt metaphor for the cupcake tunnel is your eyes.

You don't rub soap in your eyes, you just gently clean the area around them because the eyes are self cleaning, just like the coochie!

As a freshman, going to library walk is like a key thing to do right?? and to try and join as many orgs as I could so I can get a feel of the different people and see who I vibe with? I remember seeing one group on triton day and I immediately when to their booth or tent or whatever its called lol and was immediately ignored. I was told to just fill out stuff on a laptop and the people went back to talking to their other friends behind the table. I ignored that and hoped maybe things would be different if I went to the GBM. Nope same thing. I thought okay it's because I am an introvert and just don't vibe with these people. that's okay.

I tried joining another org (which I've realized that it's a good thing I didn't join not gonna call peoples directly out cause that aint cool) and that didn't go so well. I showed up to an event where they were having free food and I went around 30 mins after it started and people were still eating and talking, and I was told oh the events over and that was pretty much it. The food wasn't even the main reason I showed up like actually the org was full of people who I thought I was gonna really vibe with but again guess not. 

Then I found KOTX with my friend. The people were friendly at the booth. That was a good start. Went to a GBM and they were really fun. I was with my friend that time, but she couldn't go to their next event but I wanted to go cause I thought this org would be the one. So, me being the introverted and anti-social af person I am, was surprised that I went to their bonfire. And even more shockingly was warmly welcomed and even met some of my close friends there. I went from knowing no one to literally spending 75% of my time with all of these people. I'm still shocked cause nani the fuck im so awkward and introverted its gross

So maybe I truly didn't vibe with other groups, but it definitely isn't because I'm introverted. KOTX may not be for everyone, but give it more than one chance imo. In my experience, KOTX isn't as clique or clicky(?) (idk how to spell) as many make it out to be. It's definitely not the cliquest org out there.

In this day and age, going outside is sometimes risky.  A new thing that‚Äôs been going on is people getting into fake Ubers and getting assaulted.  As a result I feel the need to make a PSA on how to avoid having that happen to you

1) Alright so the first tip is pretty straightforward.  So every car has these plates on the front and back with numbers and letters identifying them called ‚Äúlicense plates‚Äù.  Now not many people know this but Uber actually displays the license plate of the car that‚Äôs meant to pick you up.  So what you want to do is when you‚Äôre about to get picked up, you open the Uber app, look at the license plate of the car of your driver, then look to see if the car you‚Äôre about to get into has that number.  If you do this I can guarantee you‚Äôll get into the right car every time.

2) Now let‚Äôs say that‚Äôs a bit too difficult for you.  Maybe you‚Äôre here going ‚ÄúAre you serious?  7 digits and letters?  I can‚Äôt remember those:‚Äù well the good thing is I have another failsafe tip.  In addition to giving license plate numbers, Uber actually provides you with the physical appearance of the car.  So if for whatever reason you can‚Äôt compare license plate numbers, you can just look to see if the car you‚Äôre getting into matches the description of the car on the app.

3) Alright this final tip is actually quite complicated and should only be used as a last resort should the first two methods fail.  So if the license plate trick and the car trick both don‚Äôt work you‚Äôll have to do a visual comparison of the driver.  First you look at the pic of the driver in your Uber app then look at the driver of the car you‚Äôre about to step into.  If they look like the same person then get in.

I hope you have all found this PSA informative.  Stay safe everyone",,serious,,Tue,9.0,7.0,40.29299999999989,79.13400000000009,41.98700000000009,0.054,0.86,0.087,0.9193,16

I regained the ability to cry last year, and since then, I rarely go more than a week without crying. I have trouble falling into a deep sleep and usually can't fall asleep until 3 at the very earliest, an issue which probably doesn't help low moods (likely related, though.) For a while, depression and burnout from life in general had kind of taken away my ability to feel sad. Self-loathing bred passive resignation, particularly in regards to whether I was capable of being loved or receiving affection. Now, though, matters of love are playing a part in my becoming reacquainted with sadness. When I see people in relationships, I yearn for the little things. My suite-mate and their SO brush their teeth together, often laughing alongside each other. I don't want to admit it, but my heart kind of hurts when I see it. It's not a feeling of resentment, just a sense of sorrow about not sharing that bond with another person. I don't care about holding hands for appearances sake (showing someone off to aid my ego), but I yearn for the feeling of knowing someone who would see my hand as one worth holding. Trying to do little things to put myself out there, but I don't know how to not look distressed. I cherish my friends and like what I do, so I have other sources of refuge to help me as I work through a lot of underlying issues at least.

I think boxers might be okay, but tbh I don't like shorts on my bare coochie. 

The yeast infection pills are really hardcore, and you might get into a yoyo cycle with them, especially if you are prone to  yeast infections. I definitely recommend the cream (clotrimazole) instead, though it gets a bit messy (you can wear pads, or, again, long skirts with no underwear)

if you put time into your cooter's health (such as sleeping with no undies on CONSISTENTLY, hydrating, avoiding sweets, eating plain yogurt, etc), you will reduce the chance of developing a yeast infection in the first place, rather than mitigating the symptoms. 

Another thing that can cause yeast infections is shaving, because it can be irritable (those are usually gonna be external yeast infections that you want to treat with cream, not pills), so if you can, avoid shaving and try to trim instead, or use products made for sensitive skin, and specifically for the bikini line. (I also heard waxing might work, but I have never gotten waxed)

They broke up and our friendship became closer but while I knew that her character (like ambition or empathy levels) wasnt the best fit to mine (I would care too much she would care too little about things; I loved to try new things she hated doing that stuff) our hobbies and everything else matched and we've had lots of fun times and laughed together. When we first met we had an almost fwb start; we didnt have sex or anything but I've felt up her boobs and she's touched my dick and we enjoyed cuddling a lot. Then we stopped once she got a boyfriend but we still maintained our friendship. I feel that now that I've known her for so long, I've grown past the lust part of our friendship and love her wholeheartedly. Sometimes though, when she talks about getting another boyfriend, I catch myself thinking ""I can be your ideal boyfriend."" But realistically I know that our relationship wouldnt last because our personalities are so different and I'm also scared to tell her because I dont want to ruin what we have; it's gotten me through a lot and she's really been a beacon of support, despite how many times I have to bother her to try going out her comfort zone or to even help me with a chore here or there. It's tough because other than the personality clashes, she's my ideal type and I just love *her*. I love her smile and how her eyes light up; how elegant she looks when she crosses her legs. I love how she can be totally wacky and say some really random things sometimes and how we can laugh about the weirdest stuff together. But I know if we were to get into a relationship I've friendzoned myself so hard at this point that it's would be completely one-sided. I used to see her message her boyfriend all thr time and she would be sending him pictures and videos and messaging him all the time. I dont think she would go as far for me. Like yes I do get stuff, but not to the same level as her boyfriend, whom she loved. After they broke up, when she talks about her I get a little uncomfortable because one, ik she be lying cuz I talked to the dude, and we're homies and some things did not actually happen lol. But also it was just weird but not painful to picture her together with him. So I'm very confused about my feelings.

With the juice world tindr thing, our friend group has enjoyed being on tindr. Recently, we just made hers and while it was fun swiping with her, when she told me that she was kinda excited at the prospect of being in a relationship again i was a little sad. But not sure if I like her romantically or because I'm losing probably the greatest friend i ever had because i know that when she gets a boyfriend I'm not going to be able to hang out as much as we do now.

11138,2019-04-12 19:09:31,"So I had an idea and would love some feedback. 

There are a lot of great clubs on campus that students can involve themselves where they can grow in their field and become a part of a community but the biggest problem is that not many people know about them. Why?
   
Because it takes a lot of effort and talent to actually make good flyers to catch people's attention but members, let's say in a specific engineering club, won't necessarily have the spare time or Photoshop/editing skills to get in done nicely.   

That's why I want to propose a program which UCSD should start where students who are majoring in Visual Arts and have experience in media, photography, and graphic design etc. can join these clubs specifically for the purpose of designing  and managing these recruitment materials (flyers, website, facebook page) in exchange for 1 unit of credit per quarter. 

It's a win/win situation because these students can build up their portfolio, gain experience working with teams and get credit to graduate, while the club gets an established on-campus and online presence. 

What do you guys think? Is this a good program for UCSD to consider?",[redacted],,,Fri,10.0,1.0,54.44799999999994,39.17600000000006,47.891,0.016,0.764,0.22,0.9933,19

A short time ago, I fell fairly hard for this lady who I see precisely twice a week for a total of four hours per week. She is a (very senior) member of the club I am in and I never ever see her anywhere outside of club meetings ever. We never really talk during the club meetings because most of the biweekly two hour meetings are devoted to club business and because she typically walks in late and/or leaves immediately after the meetings end. And when we do have free time before/during/after the meetings themselves, I never really have an opportunity to engage her because she's typically engaged with all of the other senior club people (since they're all really close friends outside of the club) and it would just be horribly awkward and rude if I cut off or butted into their conversation. We share no classes together, nor do we ever bump into each other on campus, so there's never really been a chance for spontaneous conversation to occur. I've never been particularly concerned about initiating and maintaining the conversation, since I'm a pretty good conversationalist and so is she (from what I can infer) and we both have fairly similar interests (more similar than practically all my previous crushes). We're also connected to one another on Messenger and Instagram, but I sense I wouldn't have much success by going the inbox route, since she is busy ad perpetuum (coursework, club work, and work work too, I'd presume). Also I haven't the slightest clue about where I'd even begin, how I'd initiate conversation online considering we still don't know each other very well (although luckily we aren't strangers). At this point, I don't know what to do. I feel like I've reached my wit's end. It's gotten to the point where I am beginning to fervently hope/pray for some kind of break, anything at all, any chance encounter or opportunity anywhere. I understand that things like this happen and them's the breaks, but it's still so incredibly frustrating. Irrespective of what happens though, I'm still gonna shoot my shot, since I haven't a thing to lose by doing so. And I understand that irrespective of how much foundation I build up between her and myself, she may still shoot me down for reasons that are totally beyond my control (or alternatively, she may accept simply out of interest). It's just that I want to reduce the probability of being shot down (however great that may be) as much as possible (however much that amount may be).

I am working on starting a new student publication and am recruiting a staff or contributors to write about the question of what it means to be a college student.
College appears singular and monolithic to those who are outside of it. Unavoidably, we hold this viewpoint before we enter college, and often pick it up once again after we have long forgotten about all of our experiences. For four years, however, we know that the collegiate experience is ultimately a complicated, holistic and imperfect process.
We can pen a deeper reflection of all the personal stories, ideas, and experiences which come together and describe the college experience. What are those issues which make college at UCSD unique? To me, this ends up being Geisel, food, our international student body, and our (soon to be) seven colleges: we seem to be cursed with bad food on our campus, I wonder if our large international student body obligates us to greater degrees of inclusion and integration, and finally, how will the Chancellor‚Äôs plans to eventually guarantee four-year housing change campus life? These are some of the questions I hope to pursue with a dedicated and intelligent staff or thoughtful contributors.",[redacted],,,Thu,9.0,9.0,73.50000000000014,38.42999999999997,82.32000000000008,0.026,0.869,0.105,0.9678,17

This school has a way of normalizing every individual into a number and spitting out odds of getting into graduate school, a career, etc. Is it good to be realistic and pragmatic? Without a doubt. Is it good to let statistics and averages determine whether or not you can do something? I'm not so sure. There's a reason interviews and essays exist; every individual is a unique human being that has capacity to contribute, and no amount of grades or test scores can hamper that.

Academics are the basis of any graduate school and are important. But those two things by themselves don't make you stand out in any capacity, because like I said, most applicants all have great scores. Medicine is about so much more than just being ""smart""; you're devoting a huge chunk of your life (arguably your prime years) to helping people (note this is not restricted to pre-meds, this applies to nurses, midwifes, public health majors, etc.  ). If you're going into healthcare, you need to be a well-rounded and passionate individual; again, good grades and MCAT in this example are great, but not sufficient. I feel like I came off as a butthurt jealous pre-med so I should clarify my GPA is about average and my MCAT score is above average, so I'm no academic stud myself. Despite that, I devoted a LOT of hours pursuing projects and organizations that I am passionate about and love spending time on.

Clarified point of my confession: work hard and do your best in academics, don't let them define you.

Recently, I'm particularly interested in one guy who is pretty new to tinder. The first time we met, we got to know each other, and I was a little surprised to hear that he didn't have that much experience with sex. Like Idk, he's a solid 8 or 9 and he's a whole foot taller than me. Anyways, after we had sex, he told me that he really liked being with me and that he didn't want to just leave right after because he didn't want me to feel used. When he said those words, it really made me happy because I just want a relationship with some substance. Of course, it's too soon to say that we'll turn into something serious, but him saying that gave me a lil hope. 
He's also super affectionate, and I kinda forgot how much I liked hugs and soft pecks until he came along. Actually, I tend to be uncomfortable/tense around new people, but I feel very comfortable with him physically. Like his embrace is just very comforting and addictive. SO the combination of the fact that we vibe pretty well, his particularly pleasant affection, and his somewhat wholesome intentions has got me pretty hooked. 
3 or 4 days after we meet, he hits me up first and we end up talking and cuddling for a few hours. He tells me that he got out of a relationship before spring break, and he kinda told me that he didn't think we were anything serious. Idk if he meant that he didn't want to, but yea it was a little discouraging ngl. BUT I can understand why he's more hesitant to jump into something. He did share that he just hated being lonely, so I think we're on the same page in that sense. After that, we rambled on about other stuff, and he started to get sleepy. He really wanted me to stay the night, but I wasn't down because I had an 8 am. He told me again that he thinks that we get along really well for some reason. Before I left, he hugged me for a long time and told me that he liked being with me.
Since then, I can't get him out of my mind. Like damn I don't wanna be a sucker for words, but now I smile whenever I think about him. Despite all that sweet stuff, I am also trying to not be invested in case he loses interest and finds another girl. This has happened to me two or three times, so I'm just worried that this is gonna be that same situation. I want to keep seeing him, but I'm feeling insecure about us as well.

They tease each other a lot and there is a lot of physical contact/pda in general between them (i.e. sharing food, petting each other, talking to each other in cute voices, etc). Additionally, she is really involved with his personal life and friends from high school. For example, she is really good friends with his high school ex, who he only broke up with a couple months ago. We‚Äôve asked both of them whether or not they like each other and my roommate has said no and his friend has said that she used to like him but not anymore. We feel like that‚Äôs kinda bs considering how much physical contact there is and how close they are. Any thoughts?

TLDR; I have this male roommate who is really close with a female friend and my friends and I want to know whether there is something going on between them or not

I am disgusted by how easy it was to play the graders for my DEI course.
So I having had more than 12 units that quarter, decided to take my DEI for pass no pass just to have one less course to worry about. 
So on one assignment, I straight up didn't read it, so what I did was I read the title, and the first 2 or 3 sentences of each paragraph just to kind of get an idea of what was happening. and just related it to me being Asian and my ""struggles"" that I heavily exaggerated and made analogous to the topic, and got an A on it. So again, I'm Asian, and the TA responsible for grading me was a white woman. So what I did was I played around with her, and tried writing things with the same strategies and noticed that all it took was relating to how things are either problems for women, or problems for Asians. The reason for this strategy was because I believed that she would appreciate me exaggerating women's problems that don't really exist, and that she felt she couldn't challenge me on my bullshit because she doesn't know what it's like to be Asian. and sadly to say it did work. and just to really confirm it, I tried one paper where I actually did read the readings, and objectively wrote about it and then changed gears and undermined the women's issue that was being discussed, and got a bad score on it. 

And the reason I decided to write this now is because I did get a full time job. and Nothing I've learned in my DEI is worth a fuck to the company nor to me.

and so I can fairly say that the DEI was a waste of my time and money. and fuck you UCSD for making me take it.

I felt like they'd find out I wasn't a CSE major and ask me to leave. It was doubly intimidating as a female. I just didn't feel like I belonged there.

11066,2019-04-09 23:35:38,"Honestly hate my roomate. I met her last year in an org and we became pretty close, enough that I considered her to be one of my closes friend. Little did I know of just how sus, crazy and fake she is. Like I never really noticed certain things about her, but the longer I lived with her, the more and more I started disliking her. She always tries to be the center of attention, never apologizes even though she knows shes in the wrong, tries to victimize herself in every situation as to seem that she didn't do anything wrong, and all around fake. She would also have a different problem everyweek and would be in a depressed mood, we would try to help her out but she literally had a new problem each week so we just grew tired of trying to even help her, seeing as though she rarely listen to our advices or is even appreciative of it. Its not just me either, some of our other friends that knows about the situation also have started to dislike her, but those that doesn't know still adore her and doesn't think anything wrong of her. I dont want to ruin their image of her because I don't think its my place to tell them what to think of a person but I also think its unfair that they hold her on this pedestal and believe her to be this great person.

I don't really know what to do. I know that she has some mental issues (depression, suicidal thoughts) and by pushing her away more I feel like it might get worse for her. Like I said, some of our mutual friends have also distanced themselves from her too so she doesn't have the support system that she used to have but also I don't want to be fake. I don't want to pretend that I'm there for her when I'm not anymore or that everything is fine and dandy. We already rarely talk anyways even though we share the same room, but I still have a whole quarter to live with her and it just seems my home has become an unwelcoming environment.

[trigger warning]
Unrelated to why I dislike her now, but I think she might be gay. She had this weird fascination with one of our girl friend (which i think she liked) and ever since our friend got a boyfriend she started acting worse. Not really sure if its the case or not, but it might explain why my roomate was so obsessive with our friend and literally centered a lot of her problem around our friend.

11065,2019-04-09 22:54:35,"@10846 saying you‚Äôd rather a flat out rejection from girls instead of them trying to let you down nicely, it‚Äôs tough to do since from my experience, guys can take it quite personally. For example, once I was in a friend group where there was only 1 other girl and 6 other guys, we were all friends but the guys were closer. One of them liked me, I tried letting him down nicely and curving him pretty obviously, and when I eventually flat out rejected him he was all ‚Äú_______ is a bitch, she‚Äôs a hoe anyways, she wears too much makeup i probably wouldn‚Äôt recognize her if we were dating and she got too comfortable and showed me her bare face‚Äù etc etc. really mean and hurtful things, and it influenced the way the other guys in our friend group saw me and they all stopped talking to me. 

I think a lot of girls feel this way, even if it might not be exactly like my situation i mentioned. Guys get hurt when they‚Äôre flat out rejected, and then they talk shit about the girl just for not reciprocating feelings. Sure, not all guys are like that, but how can we tell if they are or aren‚Äôt? Guys will be very sweet to a girl they‚Äôre interested in and then, like a switch, they suddenly become assholes when they realize she doesn‚Äôt feel the same.

Fuck you and your dumb snapchats about our history. I know you too well and I know every post is about me I know because I used to do the same... but you know what I grew up. 
I got over my issues of relationships and trust and started to let you in. It was going okay and then you stopped fighting right after I stepped in the ring. 

You were my best friend and maybe you knew it or maybe not but you were when I was happiest and even if my fear took over and I moved on you never gave up.    Even after you moved 3000 miles away thats when it was strongest. And no I couldnt do long distance even if we only saw each other a few times that summer you still loved me and that became my anchor.

No i couldnt say it back quite yet but I did eventually and things went slow, you went to school closer to me but still a few states away but it was always enough to keep me holding on. Sometimes the thought of you was the only thing I had because it was a constant like pi or the speed of light. 

And no we were not in a relationship but I couldnt date anyone else and you knew that and I knew you wouldnt. But you didnt trust me did you you never asked?  

If youve gotten this far there were a lot of nos above but a lot of yeses as well a lot of memories - and then you stopped, the letters that warmed my heart and the phone calls I waited for every night. So when finals got me busy and I was feeling down and I couldnt talk to you and you broke it off and cut me out you cannot weep and pull me back with your pathetic excuse for a message over your snapchat story. Have you tried to call me? Explain things? No instead you cant understand how heart broken and plain broken I am 

Ha i guess my friend was right and you just wanted me for sex in the end.

10904,2019-04-05 17:55:41,"Autistic person here (not in the way that edgelord assholes mean, can't believe people still say that shit in 2019.) Reading rooms and cues is something that I have to constantly practice, so I veer towards over-analysis and being cautious as a general rule of thumb. This keeps me out of sticky situations, but it also deters me from taking potentially positive risks. I have some great friends, but my circle is relatively limited and I am not one to put myself out there. After getting past the mental hurdle of telling someone else that I have feelings for them (didn't work out and that's okay), I have found myself feeling noticeably more attracted to people in general and it's really confusing. My game-spitting skills are non-existent. I can't tell when or if someone is sending me signals and miss on potential opportunities to spark up conversations or flirt a bit. For example, a person smiled at me and said they recognized me from a class before asking me about how the final went, leading to a brief convo. They were really enthusiastic and I appreciated someone initiating a convo as simple as that, but I still came off as really shy throughout the interaction. Another time, someone poked me on the back to compliment me on something I was wearing and I said ""thank you"" with a smile before continuing to go about what I was doing. 

I am not particularly bad looking for someone so socially inept, but I worry that the combination of my shyness and my features make me look almost childlike. I feel like some people might read my shyness as an indicator of being asexual or aromantic, a feeling that only gets compounded when I tell them that I am on the spectrum. I recently created a tinder profile as a ""fuck it"" move, but I don't have any matches yet. My settings (within general campus/student life radius so it isn't all randos) may be contributing a bit, but it would suck if it's just that I am not drawing interest or am not cognizant of unreasonable standards that I might have. All of this is really confusing and I just wish I had the confidence to try earlier in life, rather than starting so late. Ugh.

11611,2019-04-05 01:20:36,"The guy who talked about the wage gap between the sexes is correct but approached the topic without any tact and also comes off as kind of a douche with a superiority complex. There are a number of reasons that women are paid less than men. Part of it is an overall genetic predisposition towards careers that are people-focused over object-focused. Part of it is outdated oppressive tactics like a glass ceiling. Part of it is that men are willing to work longer hours and ask for more raises. So on and so forth. It's a complex, multivariate issue and causality is difficult to fully determine but simply shouting ""OPPRESSION"" is as non-sensical as those shouting that ""MEN ARE BETTER"". The issue with the left is that they completely throw out science when it comes to the topic of sex/gender differences and cling to JUST oppression, when the issue is much more complicated than that. Are women discouraged from going into the STEM field and managerial/executive positions? Yes, even though I think that this is decreasing over time. That's something that we're going to have to continue to flush out as a society. Are women also genetically predisposed to jobs that are valued less within this society? The answer is: YES. There are solid, time-tested research articles done demonstrating the fact that differences in occupation between the genders RISE when countries adopt more egalitarian policies that remove societal biases towards one occupation or the other. The more pressing issue that I think is often overlooked is: Are we undervaluing the positions that women tend to adopt in our society? I think we are. The real systemic bias lies in this issue. Why are elementary school teachers paid such dismal rates when they're educating future generations? Why are counselors paid such dismal rates when they're taking care of the mental health of current and future youth in a time of skyrocketing anxiety, depression and self-harm rates? THIS should be the focus of discussion because it addresses a large part of the wage gap that exists within this country without forcing a particular career choice for women. 

I think the wage gap between jobs is honestly overstated. Coming from a simple logical perspective, in a competitive economy, why would business owners hire men if they can pay women 78 cents to the dollar for the same value of work? Do you know how hard it is to start or even run a business? Do you know how much overhead that business owners could save by adopting to a female-only workforce if this was true? Let's re-introduce some reasoning into this argument because it's a damn complicated problem that won't be addressed by the fucking monkey approach we have now. Let's talk about the real issues and not parrot the oppression-narrative OR the male superiority-narrative.

I wanted to throw it away, burn it, or give it to a homeless person on the street.

I decided that there was someone else who deserved it more than I, someone whose moral dignity is greater than mine. I decided that if someone could do the impossible that I couldn't, they should have no problem possessing this money. Someone who has the cunning and fortitude that I didn't. That person is one of you.

My $2500 dollars is hidden in a book on campus. It is hidden plainly within the contents of the book itself and can be removed without damaging the book itself. This book is accessible to anyone on campus and it located at a publicly accessible location. It is not in one of the dorms or apartments.

I have also left 13 clues in several other books on campus, they will lead you to the final book, which contains my money.

Lastly, I have left a secret word with the moderators of this page. There may be other posters trying to offer false clues and impersonate me, especially when they become close to finding the final book. This will verify my identity.

I wish you the best of luck.

I would eat as much as I could, drown myself in protein shakes and workout religiously. And the best part was I was seeing great results, I was becoming more muscular and starting to fill out my cloths. But one thing no one ever tells you about eating a lot of protein or a lot in general is the incessant flatulence you accrue. Fast forward to the start of a quarter, I had a writing class around noon of that day so I figured I could get a quick workout in. I hit up Rimac, got that sick pump bro and went home as fast as possible to take advantage of that anabolic window. I sloshed together the most putrid yet protein and calorie dense shake UCSD has ever known. I pinched my nose and knocked back the vile gains elixir. I had 15 minutes left before the start of the writing class so I changed and ran over. I found a middle seat and the class started on time. The professor began going over the syllabus and eventually requested we write a little about ourselves and turn it in before leaving. It had been a little over an hour since I had the shake, and at this point my GI tract was wrenching, bloating, contorting and growing. I was immediately trapped. I was frozen in my seat; the reality of what may happen struck me all at once. I ordered my rectum to batten down the hatches, shut the sphincter, all hands on the poop deck. But it was to no avail, much like a failed 1 rep bench press max with no spotter I needed to bail out from under the barbell. In the complete silence surrounding me I farted with the combined energy of 10000 suns. It lasted for a complete 20 seconds, the class still in complete silence but the attention now all on me as if I was conducting a Ted talk. Once it had ceased, I collected my things, left the class, went home dropped the class and got a haircut.

1.) Be considerate and fill up the INSIDE seats first so other students can sit down easier. If for some reason you need to sit at the edge seats, scoot your backpack under your chair. 

2.) When a lecture hall is full and there are people sitting on the stairs, you shouldn't save seats. ""first come, first serve"" doesn't apply when there is a 10 minute window from the previous lecture for all students to find a seat. 

3.) Do not enter a lecture hall, until the previous lecture is 80% vacated. As much as your passion to learn is admirable, it's absolutely rude to shove your way into a FULL lecture hall. Form a line or group away from the exits of the lecture hall so students can leave safely and efficiently.

It's kinda cool if you ask me, but it can also get really bad an depressing. Eg. Not being able to dance to a song at the club because my memory linked to it would be of a guy I considered my friend sexually assaulting me.

10822,2019-04-03 01:54:47,"Hey, so there have been recent posts about fat people. I really don't take offense to these post because I know I'm fat and would never consider myself curvy. I do believe that America's body positivity has taken a turn where obesity should be accepted but it kinda shouldn't. Being obese fucking sucks, not for looks (you are beautiful), but for health. I had a diabetes scare that really put shit into perspective. I know I can make myself beautiful with the right clothes and makeup but that will not make up for the fact that my health is in decline. 

However, there is a reason on how I got myself to be this. During middle school I was actually an average weight but I got depressed and found comfort in food when I couldn't it find in others. It took me awhile to just accept the fact that I'm fat. 

The type of ""harsh"" comment was made but it won't actually do anything. Only skinny people would agree with you (with the exception of me) and others would go agaisnt you. Fat people may call themselves curvy in order to cover the blow of being fat, but it is better promote workouts and diets than degrading fat people.

Degrading people just makes the people hate you and go against you. 

If I'm going to kill myself due to obesity at least let me die peacefully.

10750,2019-04-02 14:29:37,"So I‚Äôve been experiencing something lately and I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs advice that I‚Äôm seeking or just to simply get it off my chest

So I have these two really close friends and we‚Äôve known each other for about a three years (?). We‚Äôre about 21/22 years old but I‚Äôve been having communication issues with the both of them. 

So I‚Äôm from LA and I recently moved to San Diego to attend university so I understand that it was inevitable that we would communicate less

With one of the friends, I understand why I get slow responses from her Bc she has work and school and a bf etc etc so we generally talk at the end of the day or sometimes about once a week and it‚Äôs great. 

The other friend however, I just feel like he‚Äôs never there anymore? And he‚Äôs by no means ‚Äòbusy‚Äô whatsoever. Yes, he does attend school but that‚Äôs simply it. Of course whatever classes he‚Äôs taking may be difficult for him and maybe that‚Äôs why he doesn‚Äôt message back until 12 hours later but I just don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs why. He also doesn‚Äôt go out much. If he was out with his friends, then I‚Äôm not expecting him to message me back soon all the time but i know that he rarely goes out. When he‚Äôs not at school, he‚Äôs at his house playing games/ procrastinating from homework. 

If I message him about something that‚Äôs annoying me from a certain professor (or something), I don‚Äôt hear from this friend for basically 10-12 hours. But when I have gossip or something about an ex or whatever, he messages back instantly. 

I‚Äôm definitely not asking for him to be messaging me back instantly all the time. I mean even I can‚Äôt do that Bc I do have classes and exams but idek. I know in general he spends a lot of time on his phone A LOT, so I know he‚Äôs getting my messages and just choosing not to message back. 

It doesn‚Äôt help that when he wants to text me about help on his homework or something that‚Äôs going on in his life, he‚Äôll spam my phone and then call me if I don‚Äôt respond right away. 

One time, he spammed my phone about fifteen minutes before I was about to take a final to ask for homework help and when I wasn‚Äôt responding, he called and wouldn‚Äôt let me hang up until I helped him.

10692,2019-04-02 02:45:39,"One night in the Summer I finished fifth grade, my mom became homeless‚Ä¶ It was that night I knew exactly what hate felt like. You don‚Äôt know what hate is until you‚Äôve been in a kitchen at four or five in the morning when your dad is finally knocked out from all the booze and porn he edits and watches in the same tiny ass room as you, your sister, and your mom. Until you‚Äôve held a knife, clutching it with all your strength just wanting to pierce it through his heart. 

Hate doesn‚Äôt start off that way though. It doesn‚Äôt because it‚Äôs a gradual build. 

Dad first hits your mom. You‚Äôre just a little boy, terrified of what you just saw. Confused even. Almost all the movies you watched and all your friends‚Äô families growing up had loving parents who cared for each other. 

Then dad starts to hit your mom even harder, and he starts to hit you. Now, you‚Äôre kept up all night just daydreaming about grabbing that knife, but you can‚Äôt. You don‚Äôt have the guts to do it. I don‚Äôt think anyone ever has the guts to do it. 

He keeps hitting you, your mom, and now your sister. He still drinks. He still edits and watches porn in front of you and says nothing but insults to you. At this point, you can‚Äôt help but sit up, lie down, sit up, lie down, sit up, lie down, sit up, lie down. Just thinking of the consequences of murder. Then one night you find yourself standing with your fist clenched so tight you can break dad‚Äôs neck. Then at the kitchen door with your hands on the knob, going through all the possible scenarios. All you want to do is punch a giant fucking hole in that door.

Then finally. My mom comes home late from her closing shift at the restaurant. I still don‚Äôt know what they were fighting about (or what they ever fought about) to this day because I can barely speak Korean. All I know is that this was the fight that almost ended my entire life and his. 

The fight ended with dad throwing our mini foldable table at my mom and grabbing her by the ear or hair dragging her on the floor out of our tiny room and out of the house. I‚Äôve never wondered what the other tenants of the house were doing or thinking, while listening to dad yell, hearing me and my sister cry our asses off, and probably trying to block out my mom‚Äôs screams and pleas, until now as I‚Äôm writing this. It‚Äôs kind of weird. Although I now wish someone had come help us, I‚Äôm glad no one did. This night made us stronger and more prepared for what‚Äôs to come. 

He comes back, slams the door, and sits down at his desk. He doesn‚Äôt say a single word. I looked at my sister and I will never forget how frightened and angry she looked. I was waiting for her to stand up, grab me, and walk outside to be with our mom. It never happened. We never talked about this night, but I can only assume she was waiting for me too. Dad finally turns around and tells us to not even dare help our mom. Neither of us did, and she was forced to sleep on the balcony stairs right outside the window of our room. All I could do was look up at the window from the floor. I couldn‚Äôt look any closer because I was too scared to see my mom actually outside. I stared at the window, the floor, the window, the floor, the window until dad finally laid his blankets on the floor right in front of me and fell asleep. This was the night I skipped all the indecisiveness, the reasoning, and the daydreaming. This was the night I went straight to the knife. 

As you can tell, I couldn‚Äôt find the guts to do it that night since I‚Äôm here at UCSD and not in prison. There are still some moments I wish I had done it to this day, and there are others I am glad I didn‚Äôt. 
Thanks for reading this. I know it‚Äôs very long. I‚Äôve never talked about this night and the feelings this explicitly to anyone before. I try to have nothing but love to as many people as possible, and I hope this story moves all of you to be more kind, selfless and loving to those around you.

10668,2019-04-01 01:41:26,"This is not a confession, but some advice I'd like to post for graduating seniors or anyone looking for a job, internship, etc.  I'd like to post it anonymously so that it doesn't seem like I'm bragging.  I keep seeing post about people applying to 30+ jobs and not getting interviews.  Honestly, that's likely your problem.  You need to be spending hours customizing each application so that it's clear that you don't just want a job, but you want that particular job with that company.  Show interest in the company and show why the company is not only a good fit for you, but why you're a good fit for them.  If you send in generic resumes/cover letters, then it's going to seem like you are just looking for money and will likely leave the company if given a better offer.  Depending on where you are applying, you may want to drop off resumes in person (especially if you are looking for a job where you would be working with customers).  Always look professional and ask to speak to a manager when dropping off the resume/cover letter.  When working over the summer, I got interviews at places I was nowhere near qualified to work.  Why?- because I had a good handshake, showed up in a suit, and showed interest in the company.  Smile too!  Too often I see people showing up to interviews in jean/without their shirts tucked in.  I graduated last year and got a job offer in the fall for $80/hour.  After being offered the position, I told the company that I'd have to think about it since I still wanted to look into other companies.  They then offered me $85.  (FYI I had no internships and only graduated with a 2.9 GPA).  Know your worth.  Play up your strengths and quantify your abilities on your resume if possible.  Also, study for your interviews!  If you can't do the harder problems, buy a book a study!  Chemists/biochemists- you should be able to make buffers!  CS majors- get a book of problems and work through them.  They will ask you similar problems.  There's only so many ways to solve these and you need to find the most efficient way.  Do practice interviews and study for your interviews like you studied for your tests.  Even better, study with friends.  If you're still struggling, consider working with a recruiter who can help prep you for interviews.  Always thank your interviewers for their time and be excited about the interviews/position.  Have your ""elevator pitch"" prepared and research the company.  Coming with questions/showing your knowledge about the company will show your interest. Spell check everything you send and have someone who knows your strengths look over it.  If you know someone good at grammar, ask him to read through your cover letter/resume.  Limit your resume to 1 page and use strong verbs on your resume.  Make sure you referrals know that you'll be using them as referrals (so that they can plan to say some nice things about you).  Don't lie on your resume! 
 If there's a skill you think you need, learn it!  Some applications will require skills that no one has (like 10 years experience with a language that's been around for 9), so still apply even if you don't meet every requirement.   Also, quantify/qualify your experience/skills (X years experience, proficient vs. advanced, etc.)   Lastly, have a professional e-mail address.  If your e-mail address is something like ""babyboi420@_________.com"", then your resume is going to be trashed right away.  Be confident and good luck everyone! :)",,advice,,Mon,32.0,10.0,174.03400000000008,84.63000000000011,135.19100000000026,0.076,0.754,0.17,0.9963,01

10707,2019-03-31 16:04:26,"I wrote confession 10587 about telling a tour group to not attend UCSD because they will regret it. In response to the 2 white males that were upset with what I said, you're right. Instead, I should have said, ""Don't come here if you're a low income minority because this school only favors you if you are white or wealthy or both."" Honestly, I have never been so aware of colonization until I came to this stupid university. It is not a matter of taking advantage of opportunities or not, it is about the struggle with the financial aspect and the social climate, both of which have been consistently working against me. You would think that with the tuition we pay, the parking situation would be better and the food wouldn't be so damn expensive. If your parents can't afford to help you out, you are already obliged to have jobs while in school just to afford food and housing. Not to mention the social climate, I never met anyone with my same background. People always talked about how their parents went to college and are now doctors/engineers/insert other highly regarded career. I could never dream of joining a frat/sorority because it was so expensive. The pretentiousness and lack of empathy from other people from affluent backgrounds has made everything so much harder. In addition, I never once had a professor that looks like me. Even when you walk around campus, you see all the banners on those light posts with people's faces and most of them are white. It is easy to say, ""Oh, you just didn't take advantage of the opportunities"". Being so ignorant that you can easily say that sentence to someone without knowing their situation speaks volumes of the privilege that you have. You have no idea what it is like to be the first one in your family to do everything in this country and have no clue as to what you're doing, while constantly dealing with discrimination in the process. How about you check your white privilege and stop invalidating other people's experiences and emotions just because you are too privileged to even comprehend their viewpoint.

Dad was an alcoholic, was a pornographer and edited that shit right in front of me and my sister in that tiny ass room. He also beat the living shit out of us and my mom.
 the first friend i ever made in LA in 6th grade was one of the very few who helped me get through that shit and understood me cause his family was fucked up too. we actually met in detention the first week of school lmao prolly rlly hard to believe since we were so little, but middle school was pretty fucking lit not gonna lie. 
anyways.. we had to go to different high schools, and holy shiit! how different our lives turned out. 
my dad died right before high school (lowkey good riddance) and since he always told me id end up homeless and a beggar cause of how stupid he thought i was, I really wanted to try hard in high school and now here i am in UCSD studying MechE with a 3.6 GPA. Hopefully i find a job after graduation.. i get hella scared my dad was right all along. he haunts the shit outta me... ghosts are fucking real yall and theyre scary af. 
in contrast tho.. my friend went to highschool with our other friends in middle scbool. most of em became drug dealers and jumped into a gang including my first friend. he recently got outta prison and we finally had a conversation after 7 or 8 years on instagram (sadly we coulsnt video chat cause my girlfriend is already sleeping.) forgot to mention he wasnt a citizen so he got deported. really glad to hear that hes really motivated to start a new life and study programming tho.

10653,2019-03-30 22:01:30,"It has been two quarters here and I feel so lonely. I left high school thinking I would be ok at UCSD, despite having a small friend group in hs. But I was put inside a suite that is half international students and the rest seems like they all have their socially awkwardly problems. They get along fine, but I just don't fit in with them. Some of them talk about history and philosophy, and I don't have the knowledge of this kind of stuff to get into the conversation, while others just come out at night to play this one game religiously at night. 
I've tried some clubs, but I feel so separated in the events and meetings. I know you are suppose to like approach people, but I don't know why people come up to me. I went to one bonfire in the first quarter and I just ended up staring out at the ocean alone for 2 hours until the bonfire ended. 
My high school friends told me I had to take initiative, but its hard when you're scared of what to say. And its so much easier for other people because they go into those clubs with other people so they feel more comfortable.
When I was hanging out with my friends over break, I told them of my problem but they say I have so much potential and i'm a good-looking guy and that I shouldn't be scared, and people would love me. During that hangout I saw someone I thought looked like my old friend from my Sunday school and she was glancing at me too. She was really pretty, but I didn't want to talk to her. But my friend went over there and asked and then dragged me over there and when I was talking to her, she seemed flustered and kept on turning to her friend and giggling? but I felt so uncomfortable despite the one asking questions and in the end I just left and I hated myself. This is the perfect example of how I envision being the one making the first move in a conversation. 
Is there something wrong with me?

Better yet, don't wear any perfume or scented products at all. It is so inconsiderate and makes it really hard to do cardio workouts because breathing obviously intensifies and having to breathe in your perfume each time makes it really hard to keep working out. If you can't stand the thought of smelling like nothing when going to a gym, then can you at least go do your workout away from other people so nobody has to smell it?

If you really wanted trump impeached. You could have done it a long goddamn time ago. And the evidence for his crimes is literally public knowledge. He made an executive airstrike that killed an American 8 year old girl. he broke the emoluments clause by keeping his hotels in international countries which were then used to meet for foreign affairs with foreign officials. He used campaign money to fuck a pornstar. 

The Russia investigation wasn't at all about impeaching him. It was about the Democrats not wanting to admit they lost to trump. Well you know what, let me say it. They lost. You lost. We lost. There's no if and or buts about it. The republican party threw the election running the dumbest fucking man to have ever attempted politics, and somehow the Democrats fucked up worse and got a person that not even the Democratic firewall was willing to vote for.

And you know what, the Democratic party did deserve to lose. The country's liberal population wanted universal healthcare. You had a popular candidate that campaigned for it, and one that didn't. The DNC favored the one who didn't just because she didn't look like somebody the Republicans can easily accuse of communism and you fucking lost because of it. Plain and simple, you fucked up 

And the other thing that pisses me off the most is this. If all you needed to ""rig"" an election was russinian trollbots what does that say about the election? What does that say about your candidate if all it takes is unverified facts to make 3 states that always voted Democrats to all of a sudden vote republican? That just means your candidate SUCKED. Now if you're convinced Russia rigged the actual counts of Cotes that's a different story. But if all they did was propagate false info and that's all it took to get a turd like trump to the office then you know what, you deserved it. If you ran a likable candidate instead of trying to run some power hungry lady that's just running because she felt it was ""her turn"" after Obama, you deserve the loss. And I don't say this as a republican or a Democrat or any political party. I say this as somebody who doesn't subscribe to a party and looks at politics from a neutral point of view, nobody deserves the horror that is Donald Trump but there is no doubt in my mind that the Democratic party dug their own grave running Clinton and that's nobody's fault but theirs.",,,,Fri,11.0,18.0,74.97000000000003,61.29900000000016,62.32799999999994,0.186,0.733,0.081,-0.9956,16

My boyfriend and I recently dropped some acid after finals week to celebrate and had a pretty good time up until we decided to add some edibles to the mix. 

When the edibles hit during my trip, it felt like time itself slowed down, as well as my perception of sound. Everything looked like it was melting, almost like that one Salvador Dali painting with the clocks. When I turned to my boyfriend for help, he looked really distorted, like when Windows XP did that weird windows lag glitch. That spooked me the fuck out, along with distorted, slowed sounds and visuals ended up putting me into a scary thought loop, and eventually a horrific trip. 

During the bad trip I somehow convinced myself that my whole life was a lie and everything was fabricated by some higher being as some kind of sick joke. For 4-6 hours it felt as if I were stuck in purgatory, having repeated deja vus about finding out my life was a lie. I thought I was going to lose my mind. (tbh the experience felt like that one Naruto episode when Itachi puts Kabuto under Izanami lol)

 I think the worst part of this trip was when I thought my boyfriend and my relationship of 5 years was just a figment of my imagination. The sad thing was that I didn't want to believe that I could have possibly made this relationship up and come to terms with it. Because just the thought/idea of my boyfriend made me so happy I was willing to live and uphold that lie. 

ngl after the whole ordeal we sad and happy cried for a good hour together 

moral of the story is don't mix drugs and love your SO until just the thought of them makes you smile like an idiot <3

It‚Äôs super difficult for me to make friends because I‚Äôm super quiet/introverted/socially awkward. I want to make more friends but idk how too. It's really difficult for me to talk to others because I‚Äôm not sure what to say. I feel so lonely. I feel like I don‚Äôt fit in.

People use me as well. They use all the things I have, most times without asking. I‚Äôm super nice and I like helping others but when I need help, no one comes through. I feel super depressed and I drink a bunch of alcohol and I started doing drugs to cheer me up about my crappy life. I really want to commit suicide and I attempted it like 2 years ago, maybe nows the time :( I just feel so down and out and people say ‚ÄúIt‚Äôll get better‚Äù  or ‚Äúyou‚Äôll get through this‚Äù but I feel thats bs. I just don‚Äôt have the will to continue and my grades have suffered significantly. My gpa is below 2.0 and that makes me even more depressed/sad. Im not motivated and I miss most of my classes. People also make fun of me. Like when literally anyone talks to me, I just cheer up and it makes my day. Like I got hugged from a friend and I got teary. When I see people happy, I get kinda sad because I know I‚Äôm missing out. I‚Äôm also fairly insecure. I have family issue but its not super bad but still an issue that stresses me out. Im also atheist but I‚Äôm scared to tell my parents because of their feelings and how they‚Äôre going to take it. I told them I‚Äôm depressed and they say its a fad that kids do these days. I cant open up and express my feelings without being judged. High-school also sucked so much and I know college is different and all but that impacts me as a person so much. On the outside, I look like I‚Äôm fine/happy but on the inside I‚Äôm just crying. Everyone struggles and fights their own battles but I just need help from someone, just someone to console me. Like when one of my suite-mates says ‚Äúgoodnight‚Äù to me, I get so fucking happy.  I‚Äôm not sure wether I should leave my contact info or not. I don‚Äôt know what the reaction to this will be. My biggest fear is that someone will figure out who wrote this and that scares me. One of my suite-mates really degrades me personally, and I feel like doing something to him. I hate being myself.  My main struggle is just being so damn lonely and not being extroverted. Ive just given up of life at this point. I over think about my flaws and all. (don't want to be specific it‚Äôll become obvs) I feel like a fucking mess who is just fucked up.

But over these 3 years, there hasn't been a single day I haven't thought about him, simple things like ""what is he doing?"" ""Is he having fun?"" ""I hope he's happy"". There was a time I thought I was over him, I did not love him anymore and I didn't even want to talk to him; I wasn't needy of him.

I have actually dated a good number of guys and I can say yes, I know I'm attractive to other guys and yes, there's good guys out there. The problem is, I always end up comparing them to my ex, and as good as the guy might be he's not the guy I want. I've tried giving others a chance and no one really fulfills my needs in a partner like my ex did. How did I realize I still loved him?

10549,2019-03-25 22:25:04,"A lot on my mind so I'm just going to dump out everything I'm thinking as of this break. It's been a few years since my ex and I had parted ways, and pretty much all of the feelings have gone away now. Time really does heal, and so does getting away from their social media to not be reminded of them. Even though I don't have them on anything anymore I still feel that I care about them, but having them keep contact is too much of a burden for what it's currently worth. Sometimes I wonder how they're doing and if life has been good to them, and sometimes when I'm down I wish they had it worse than me. Regardless of what goes on I still think in my heart that they were a wonderful person during our relationship and that I wish they find happiness in what they do wherever they go. Despite our mistakes we made in high school and college I still treasure them as much as I did when we spent time together, even though I haven't talked to her in years. Recently I have been meeting new people in my clubs and other orgs too, and I think they're nice people, but it doesn't feel as warm as my first one did. I don't think I'm cut out for relationships; I feel enough fulfillment making friends that I couldn't make before. Anytime someone asks me about dating I just tell them I'm interested in someone as a placeholder.

As for my own life, as the end of my college career nears I feel more and more pressure from my family to find an internship and eventually a job. I feel as though I was never mentally prepared during admissions season in high school and if I could go back in time to replace my freshman self with me, I would save a lot of headache and disappointment to my parents. From sophomore to junior year in high school a lot of people need to make a decision that would impact how the rest of their life would play out. I wasn't ready to make such a decision then and I feel like now I'm regretting my path I've walked. A part of me tells me to get into a stable job with good security, and another part says follow a ""dream"" that could shatter as soon as my drive and ambitions do. I'm much too afraid to tell my parents that I regret my decisions, yet I still want to do my best in classes and fear failure and rejection. I'm at that point in life where many of my friends, just like many others, are going through different phases in life; getting married, getting internships/jobs, travelling the world, etc. While the only thing I've done is go to class, clubs, and a few places to travel with family. I have this unconscious benchmark of my friends' lives compared to mine and if I'm falling behind, I get scared. There are times where I wish I had the mental capacity and discipline that my friends do to go out and succeed, and live fulfilling lives. And then sometimes I wish that my parents didn't push me to go into a path that compensates satisfaction and mental well-being for stability and a good salary just to brag to family and friends during get-togethers. 

Despite all of this, I don't think I would think about committing suicide. There's still things I want to do in life, even though I feel as if I'm dragging my feet. I'm thankful for all the people I've met so far and the experiences I've gained. My one and only relationship that lasted through high school to college, although ending somewhat sourly, was something I wouldn't trade for the world. I still want to prove to my parents that I can be on my own and that coming to America wasn't in vain. I want to be a person that is successful enough to tell my kids that they can choose a path in life that they want without worry for financial problems because of my old past and parents' upbringing. I don't want to let anyone down.

Recently I met someone and we have similar interests (art, photography, hikes, etc). She just transferred and new to SD, and we chatted for like a month before meeting up for coffee. That turned into a 4 hour chat talking about ourselves, music, dating life etc. After she wanted to meet up again and we made plans to meet at a brewery.

I was late and she was waiting in her car, and it was during peak hours. I‚Äôm not into the whole bar/drinking scene, and I‚Äôve only gone to breweries during off hours like right before lunch. Anyways, obviously with so many people it was hard to make conversation. In addition, she was in a really weird mood, and after being asked, she told me that something happened and she can‚Äôt get her mind off it, and was basically texting the entire time. I tried asking what was wrong, but she didn‚Äôt want to talk about it. So I tried to make small conversations which failed because they would just end after a few sentences. In the end I suggested we leave and go our separate ways. The reason was because I felt she didn‚Äôt want to be there and she has anxiety problems and since we just met, I didn‚Äôt feel comfortable pestering her about what was wrong in fear of making her feel uncomfortable.

So a few days later she texted saying sorry for being in a weird mood, and that it‚Äôs best not to hang out again. She said after thinking it through, there was no friendship connection. At this point I‚Äôm completely confused, because I thought there was otherwise we wouldn‚Äôt have spent 4 hours talking the first time we met. I admit I did felt things were so awkward at the brewery, but I figured it was my own awkwardness, her being weird, peak hours, and the fact this was our second time hanging out.

I understand/pickup the material pretty quickly (when I'm not forced to skip half the lectures because of CSE 30 and still score terribly on the PAs because of stupid mistakes).

10528,2019-03-22 17:06:51,"I hate seeing how social media has marketed anxiety and depression like it's ""quirky"" or some shit. As someone with major depressive disorder, it fucking sucks, and I hope no one else ever has to experience it. IT'S NOT QUIRKY OR TRAGICALLY BEAUTIFUL. IT'S DRAINING AND EXHAUSTING.
It's not just being sad--at least not for me. It's feeling numb and empty, not getting excited over things I know I should be excited for. It's eating food you usually like and tasting nothing. Everything is bland, and you force yourself to eat for sustenance. It's having no motivation to do even the smallest things, like getting up to shower or brushing my teeth. Like, these are basic things I know I /should/ do, but on my bad days, I can't even bring myself to do them. I can't even bother to change out of two-day-old clothes. I can't even motivate myself to eat for fuck's sake, and because of that, I feel even more disgusting and gross. And the thing that sucks is, other people probably just think I'm lazy. It gets worse when it comes to school. I /know/ I have to get out of bed to go to lecture and lab, but some days, I just don't, and I feel guilty every time I have to email a professor or TA about my absence or turning in late work because my brain is like ""you don't deserve to do this! you were just lazy!"" when logically I know it's because of my mental illness. You know what else sucks? No matter how much sleep I get, I'll still feel tired, whether its the meds or the illness--I'll never know lmfao. And the days just go by, and on really bad weeks, I feel so detached, it's like I'm just watching myself go through the motions of life. I'm not even living. Depression and anxiety aren't quirky, and I've been dealing with them since high school. They stole my youth, so stop acting like they're some sort of personality trait. Also, institutions of higher education (or, well, educational institutions in general) need to improve how they support their mentally ill students.

Fuckboy. My friends say that he just say things like this to manipulate me and Yes his reputation is that bad. But he has never treated me wrong during this whole time I've known him. He has showed me so much kindness yet my mind blocks me from having feelings for him since I don't want to be ""one"" of his girls. He complains about going on dates with other people but can never find someone who's ever interesting as me yet I don't feel the sparks sometimes with him. I feel like another reason is the whole ""you want what you cant have"" i think about how once I do give him a chance that he's not going to be interested after.

10319,2019-03-20 21:02:44,"Ok Friends, 

As a graduating senior I have accumulated some minor wisdom from my 4 years of taking finals. I would like to impart said wisdom on all of you since there seems to be a bunch of inexperienced noobies. 
1) When coming into a classroom for an exam, try to fill the inner most seats FIRST so that the people coming in late don't have to stomp all over your feet or slap your face with their butt cheeks trying to get into that last open seat in the middle of a 20 seat aisle.

As a graduating senior I have accumulated some minor wisdom from my 4 years of taking finals. I would like to impart said wisdom on all of you since there seems to be a bunch of inexperienced noobies. 
1) When coming into a classroom for an exam, try to fill the inner most seats FIRST so that the people coming in late don't have to stomp all over your feet or slap your face with their butt cheeks trying to get into that last open seat in the middle of a 20 seat aisle.  Also, if you have a huge backpack, tuck it UNDER YOUR SEAT so that when people finish their exam they don't have to hop over 10 backpacks just to get out of the aisle to turn in their exam.

Hello there, I was wondering how I would ever talk to you but I guess I am here now, wishing for a miracle to happen. You have short hair that is just long enough to land its tips on your shoulder, beautiful smiles that seems so bright and charming to bring the sun to the dreading winter quarter, and incredible eyes that I sort of freeze when I ever looked at them. You sit in the middle of the lecture room towards the right side, and if I had to take a guess you always sit with your group of friends on the second row. If this is you, miracle has happened, I cannot ask for anything better. 

here is a little about me:

I sit in the third row on the left side of the middle section, often asking some of the dumbest questions. I also don't really pay attention to the class, and don't worry, I am not busy looking at you and being a creep, I am just bored since I am taking the class for my DEI requirement. 

What I'm trying to say is that I would like to get to know you. I don't know your name and I just see you at lecture. But I simply don't think I can talk to you, I don't want to come off as a creep. But I am a pretty outgoing person, its just that past experiences make me anxious when it comes to talking to girls. and what the hell, the quarter is over and I am probably never going to see you again. so here is my shot, and maybe I'll even talk to you after the final.

if you read this, thank you.

Your tests are not that hard: I was just sleepy and not focused. You teach class too early and do not cover the homework material sufficiently in class.

Overall bach, I am sorry for using such profane words to describe you. I hope you did not take it personally, for I was just a sad CS student failing your class. However, going to every single office hour session after failing the second midterm saved me, and I can candidly tell you that I liked the class and am excited to take you again next quarter for CSE 21.

i'm part southeast asian, part other asian that I won't mention because that would probably easily identify me to my friends, a fourth year STEM major guy, and pretty sure i'm trans and want to be a girl. i've never felt complacent being manly or a guy. for the last year and a half, and especially the last few months my dysphoria acts up a lot. 

last summer one of my friends took me shopping since I told her I really wanted to try on a dress. when i tried it on and took pictures, I felt super happy. it was one of my best days of my life. i look at the pictures occasionally to make myself feel a little better if i'm feeling particularly dysphoric. in addition i'm hanging out with a few girls this week for a study session, and in the group chat the one girl i've told i'm trans to (jokingly) to the others said that I was a part of the girl's club. i smile a little bit whenever I look at that message, because I knew she knew and wanted to make me happy.

it's still hard though. trans asian-american females, and southeast asian ones at that (and STEM!) are a very small minority and I feel lonely most of the time. i've told a few friends, and they've been super nice to me about it, but i never know where to go. i'm not really out yet, and i've tried taking so many trips to the mall by myself to go buy a dress or skirt but stop in front of the store and fail because i'm scared. I also don't really vibe much with the other people at the lgbt center sadly. reddit as a space isn't much better. most if not all pictures of trans individuals there are white, so where I do I fit in?  

the worst part is that i always think that this part of me, this desire to be someone that I cannot, is wrong and shouldn't be. I don't like that to be who I want to look like and feel i might have to physically through hormones modify my body or go through years of voice feminization practice. 
why couldn't I have been just born a girl?
if i tried telling my parents this, i'm afraid of the family cutoff. I'm bi as well, but it feels much scarier trying to tell an asian family as a boy you want to be a girl rather than telling them you like other boys. 
I also really like my extended family from the two asian cultures I come from. i'm lucky enough I get to visit them in the two home countries a lot, but i'm scared of blowback, because losing the chance to connect with them feels like losing a part of myself. and when i'm already struggling with my gender identity, why not let the cultural one be lost along the way? 
i'm basically avoiding studying for finals, as you can tell. i'll probably try one day this week to go to the mall and see if I can work up the courage to buy a skirt or something. i love gender dysphoria <3

10385,2019-03-17 21:36:03,"While reading another confession and looking up what a sock on the doorknob meant, I ran into this gem. #CSE120

'A solution to a real life synchronization problem. The doorknob/sock combo is essentially an unenforced mutex object. If a roommate thread violates the mutex, either (linux dorms) the locking thread receives a SIG_COITUS interruptus or (Win98 dorms) the system crashes with an orgy sharing violation (thx m_turner!).

In practice: Both roommates want some private time in the room, but neither must enter while the other one is busy. When one roommate wants exclusive access to the room, they place a sock on the doorknob. Both are instructed not to enter the room if they see a sock in the door, and to wait until later. The sexiled roommate can check the doorknob at regular intervals or perhaps use exponential backoff timing between checks.
In code (for each roommate thread):

while(testAndSet(sockOnKnob)) {
    enterRoom();
    privateFunction();
    leaveRoom();
    removeSock();
}

This is an example of a spinlock using an atomic (uninterruptable) testAndSet() function. It assumes that both roommates are not in the room at the time the algorithm begins. Spinlocks in general are inefficient since the waiting roommate(s) are not doing anything productive while waiting. In a semaphore system, for example, the roommates would have pagers that would allow them to communicate via interrupts.'",,funnycs,,Sun,3.0,6.0,24.786000000000005,49.086000000000084,26.324999999999964,0.028,0.917,0.055,0.4497,21

I feel like they can just be replaced bc they dont want to share personal stuff etc...
I need more girl 'SPACE' (and i emphasize the 'space' bc I'm not looking into reverse harem shit yet) friends bc like just hearing like how deep girls get into conversation and the fact that they can just talk for hours is really appealing. 
But like its also sad bc my girl 'space' friends always think I like them jbc i spend a lot of time with them, which makes them pull away. Plus its even more ironic bc the girls I like always friendzone me and then shun me bc they didn't expect that i was actually gonna stay and try to be a good friend to them ;(

3 years ago, my ex broke up with me (i didn't want to). About a month after, one of his friends who I used to like before dating my ex started casually flirting with me, and kinda trying to get my ex completely out of my head i flirted back, although this lasted like a week at most. I knew the guy and my ex got along well, but had no idea to what extent their friendship went, and from what I still know he's just the kind of ""friend"" who's more than an acquaintance but less than a best friend or actual friend. To put this into perspective, they never engage in a conversation unless they're in the same place, where they friendly greet each other and start talking non stop (this is as much as I know about them). Anyways, he left for college and 4 months later came back and asked me out. At this point, my ex and I weren't talking, I asked for no contact when we broke up and I really wasn't interested in having a friendship with him, only being in ""friendly terms"" but we agreed I would message him whenever I wanted this to happen. So I went out with this guy, and ended up sleeping with him. He was my first and not my ex, because I didn't feel ready with my body while I was with my ex but I felt comfortable one year later and wanted to try. We started a fwb type of thing, although I later found out myself he was kind of my rebound to try and stop loving my ex. Stuff happened between this guy and I, and we stopped talking. Somewhere between this, I messaged my ex back because I felt I had ""already forgotten about him"" and was ready to just be on friendly terms. This was roughly 6 months after the breakup. Fast forward 6 more months, and after not seeing him for a year we met up (he wanted to know how I was doing) and I realized i still cared for him. Fast forward 4 more months and I travelled to the US from my home country, he came to visit me for a weekend, so did i, and we hooked up. This is when I knew I still had lingering feelings for him. Fast forward 6 months and he invites me to stay over at his apt. We hook up again, we cuddle and this is when I realized I actually still love him. We're still hooking up, and we've both confessed we still have feelings for each other. It took me this long to realize I want him back, and he's the reason I am never satisfied with any guys I try to date. However, the more I realized he DID matter to me, the worse I felt about sleeping with someone he knew. I want him back, i love him and only him but I can't bear to make a move feeling this guilty, and I don't know why if 1) we were broken up, 2) i didn't know and still don't know if their friendship goes beyond a friendly exchange of words at certain meetings once a year plus didn't care since I wasn't talking to my ex and 3)  i didn't even want to get back with him at that point, in fact I wanted him out of my life as much as I possibly could, so I couldn't love him ever again. Should I still tell him? I'm desperate to make a move but feel nervous and don't want to lose him.

Also at our last lecture, you fucks started clapping while the prof was still talking. I mean wtf is wrong with your sad lives.

He was willing to go past the time he set so that he can teach us and have us fully prepared. But you fucks want to make sure that everyone knows you're leaving cuz you're so special.. Congrats. Just be considerate and leave quietly.

buttholes have a much tighter grip.

you don't get pregnant fucking in the butthole

they are so much more beautiful than vaginas. not to mention they are part of the ass, which is the best physical feature of a woman which makes it that much more beautiful.

i just don't wanna believe god is real if he would make fucking in the butt painful. if i was god, i would design buttholes to be easily and enjoyably fuckable for both parties. in fact that would be a great engineering feature on a human being. recreational sex in the butt and reproductive sex in the front. 

and on that same note, that's not fair that there's no way for women to understand the joy of having anal sex. women should have some kind of limb down there too that can penetrate a butthole so they can understand how much more beautiful buttholes really are. and no, straps on are not the same because your clit isn't being blessed by the touch of the inside of anal walls. and i sincerely wish there was a way for you to understand why there isn't anything that feels better than anal walls chocking on your dick.

i love buttholes. and i love women who are so devoted they are willing to let us fuck in the butthole and my only wish is that one day, there's a way i can reciprocate the favor in a way so that you can also appreciate the beauty of buttholes.

I feel we work so well together and so does she, as she‚Äôs said on a few occasions. She‚Äôs been the most reliable partner I‚Äôve had and I just feel my heart thunder when I‚Äôm around her.

 I‚Äôm happy with where we are now, so I don‚Äôt want to jeopardize anything by telling her how I really feel about her. I‚Äôm trying to be as kind and thoughtful as possible around her, bringing her treats,  sending her cute dog vids when she‚Äôs feeling down, and trying to give her sincere and creative compliments.

I just hope that if we spend enough time together she‚Äôll eventully catch some feelings, because we could honestly be the most kick-ass power couple. She sometimes send me signs that I would perceive as being potential romantic interest, but I just feel she‚Äôs so busy and has so many options she would never pick a gremlin like me :( . Any advice for a lonely, lovesick boy at the end of his wits?

Also why do people leave super early and right after finals? I get you want to not do ""school work"" but people always talk about wanting to hang out throughout the quarter. But because schedules don't align, it's hard to meet up with friends outside of orgs.. Then the few times when you do have time (aka after finals or a couple days before and after breaks) everyone just wants to get the fuck out. 
Everyone's still trying to enjoy themselves with the people of their home town.... I came to college thinking it's a start of a new chapter in my life and I wanted to enjoy myself and make more long lasting friendships here but everyone just wants to hang out with you when it's convinience during the quarter and try to dip asap during the weekends or after finals.",,serious,,Fri,8.0,10.0,20.97599999999999,26.82800000000004,27.587999999999973,0.109,0.765,0.126,0.7465,00

I am only writing this to see other people's thoughts of what is going on in my head. Please don't write things like ""hmu OP."" I'm not here to try to make myself feel better or something. I don't know. If I seem like a kid that doesn't appreciate what he has, I am sorry. I try to be as grateful as I can, especially to my family. They try to give me a better future in their own way. This was just what I wrote in an hour when left to myself for an hour.

Some backstory. I'm just your average kiddo trying his best. My dad left to America when I was six to work and  I lived with my mom my entire until I came to live with my Dad for high school. I have always been told to do my work now and good things will eventually come. I'm still waiting for them to come. I have been suicidal for too many years that I can't count anymore. Or maybe not. Is it normal to think about killing yourself? I've only ever seriously tried to commit suicide three times and that was when I was much younger. The other times I pussyed out. I don't think I'll commit suicide anymore either. I've spent most my life saying, I've already toughed this much out, might as well wait for good times. Anyways, the rest of this is kind of long and just my thoughts. I tried to paragraph them the best I could, I hopped between topics that were on my mind so if it is hard to read, I'm sorry.

Your life is a joke. Your family are basically robots and they don't care about shit other than success. Asian culture is possibly the worst possible methodology of raising a child. Raising a kid and allowing him to pursue his passion is what is always preached but never used. I've actually had my parents straight up say they don't care what my passion is. It's like I'm not living my own life. I'm just walking down a pre-laid path, stumbling around until I die. I wonder what the suicide rates among asians are compared to the rest of the population. Is it really a tragedy when a student commits suicide? Is it really uncommon? There was already a student that committed suicide this fall quarter, but nobody addresses it. They just brush it under the rug and pretend like it has never happened. I didn‚Äôt even know until now. What kind of system does that? Is it a fault in our system that causes that? If i were to commit suicide, I feel as if I was determined, It would already be too late. I‚Äôm a stubborn guy haha. If i was like ‚ÄúThis is it and i will commit suicide‚Äù I would always be curious what kind of people are truly kind and true to themselves. As much as I criticize on my family for only being there for face value and never really showing others how they really feel, I honestly do the same. I feel as though I might be a sociopath or psychopath in that sense. I wonder if all my family is like that.

They never really show their emotions and they just do whatever it takes to better their own state. They don‚Äôt take into account other people and they will easily throw someone to the curb in order to better themselves. I feel as though they only do charity or seem kind so that they can front or tell themselves that they are genuinely good people. I do that too. I‚Äôm not a saint. I‚Äôm a major hypocrite. All my life I‚Äôve been wondering if I am a good person. Do good people really doubt whether they‚Äôre even nice? They just do it unconditionally. If I have to think ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to be a good person‚Äù, I can‚Äôt be a genuinely good person. I'm proud to say unlike my family that I feel sympathy though. I hold so much sympathy and patience for so many people. Except my family. I don't know why, but my patience runs thin with them and I get frustrated so easily by them now. Maybe its because my family is the only people who I get to see behind the curtains. I see them when they pretend to be nice. Laugh at other peoples jokes and then turn around and scoff at how they‚Äôre stupid. They‚Äôre lack of sympathy and empathy, projecting their anger on anyone even if they have nothing to do with anything.

I remember specifically this one time, my family was traveling and we took a taxi to a hotel that took a longer route just to make money. I understand it is scummy and hey they shouldn't have done that and taken advantage of us.I would be mad too. But since the taxi already left there wasn‚Äôt much we could do. Then my father went into the hotel and berated the woman who was working the front desk for what the taxi service has done. Why? That person had nothing to do with what they did. Why would you get worked up and mad at her specifically? They can‚Äôt do anything about it. I tried to calm him down and tell him to relax. What would yelling at them do. They aren't even responsible for what happened. And then he pushed me to the side and yelled at me. He said ‚ÄúTHIS DOES NOT INVOLVE YOU.‚Äù After he was done yelling at the clerk, he came over to me and said ‚ÄúSee? This is why you can‚Äôt let them take advantage of you. Never just get stepped on and always stand up for yourself.‚Äù Did you really think that was a valuable lesson? A teaching moment? All it let me know is that I can't believe in my family. They can't be my role models. They honestly aren‚Äôt anything like me. The dad that I have memories of, the one that I remember that had so much happiness and saw the world with so much love and care and sympathy, was very different then the real one I have. I guess it‚Äôs just the memory of a kid that's 6 years old that romanticize everything and sees people as perfect. But i don‚Äôt know. When I was younger I still knew my dad had anger issues. But it was Ok. Because he was still a  good person at heart right? 

My mom is a different story. I‚Äôm not sure what fond memory I have with her. All I remember is being forced to do things I didn't want. All I remember is getting beaten all the time. The memory that comes to me most is when I was in the corner and she punched me in the face and I fell on the ground. The memory is so muddled now and I can‚Äôt remember why she did it anymore. All I remember was the shock, pain, and sadness. Most of what is messed up with me I feel like is sourced from my mom. I actually think I might have been traumatized haha. My mom and my brother used my fear of the dark against me to make me do what they wanted. All I wanted to do was play with my friends and I understand that work needs to be done but I only got to work when I was younger. All those times locked in the garage and the basement. I still remember the fear and the hours I spent crying. I remember one time when I wanted to run away from home, and actually got the courage to do it. I left. And ran. Crying the entire time. Of course I couldn't even outrun my sister. She convinced me to come back. Her kindness is the only thing in my family. And when I came back the look on my moms face. Devoid of any sympathy. Just straight anger. Hilarious.

I'm not sure. Maybe I'm just lonely. I've tried to fill my life with things that might make me feel better. I've taken drugs before. I've surrounded myself with friends. But whenever I'm alone I always think like this. Nothing really gets better. Loneliness can't really be solved by anything.

10082,2019-03-12 15:51:54,"I had the purest, most wholesome relationship in the world. We developed a strong friendship at the age of 15, got together at 16, had our first kiss at 17 and lost our virginities to one another at 20. He wasn‚Äôt the best-looking guy and he was far from an ‚Äúalpha male‚Äù but he treated me like I was gold every single day of our relationship. I can honestly say that he had never hurt me. We had a great connection and had every intention to spend the rest of our lives together.

...Until I started wondering what else was out there. I looked around campus and saw other girls with these great-looking jock-types. I listened to stories of my friend as she hopped from the beds of player to player, making it sound as exciting as possible. Hook-up culture was rampant and hot guys were like trophies. When I saw girls at or below my smv pull alpha jock types, I started to stupidly wonder if I was ‚Äúselling myself short‚Äù. I‚Äôm ashamed to say that I actually began looking down on my poor boyfriend.

I broke up with him at 21, on summer break, simply stating that I felt like we had grown apart. Then fall quarter It didn‚Äôt take long for me to be approached by the most typical ‚Äúalpha‚Äù player jock that had ever lived. It‚Äôs actually hilarious how typical he was. Being hungry for what I felt like I‚Äôd been ‚Äúmissing out on‚Äù, I took him up on his offer and we became fwb. I knew it wouldn‚Äôt last- I‚Äôd heard all the stories and seen all the examples. But I decided that the experience was worth the potential outcome.

The potential outcome indeed happened. I found myself getting attached to him. Deeply. Just like the cliche goes, he didn‚Äôt feel the same (although he sure claimed to in order to keep me as a lay). He had an abundance of options, way too many to fall for lil‚Äô old me. I fell deeper and deeper as time went on to the point where I found it damn near impossible to let him go. I got badly hurt and embarrassed time and time again but whenever I tried to leave, he would pull me back, likely for the ego boost. It took him leaving the country for me to ‚Äúlet him go‚Äù.

Now,because of this fiasco, I feel dead inside. I can‚Äôt stand knowing that I left such a wonderful relationship for such a dumb reason. The most messed up part? My ex boyfriend told me that he still loved me and he forgave me for what I did. He was even open to getting back together. I couldn‚Äôt. I could no longer feel any kind of attraction to him anymore. In fact, I couldn‚Äôt feel it for anyone. Instead of having an n count of 1 (my potential husband), I now have a raised one. I can only see loneliness in my future; marriage is a far-fetched fantasy. This, I brought entirely on myself.

Let me tell you a guy whether shy or not WILL always go out of their way to get your number/talk to you if they are INTERESTED in you.

So my boyfriend is coming home this wknd for his spring break, and since it's long-distance, we call every night. During my call tonight, he makes a joke about feet and I teasingly ask him if there are any other kinks he should warn me about. While I was the one to bring it up, I didn't really think it through, I just meant like other weird things that he's into, but now after talking I realize that.. . yeah kinks are sexually explicit. We hadn't brought any of this other stuff up before and I was just so shook,, this man was so straightforward with me (which I appreciate bc we love each other but nonetheless shook). Here I am planning to cuddle up with him, considering that I've literally only kissed him on the cheek, and he's waiting to see my thoughts on x-y-z. While yeah I would maybe want to try certain things and am willing to keep an open mind, I really want to keep it above the waist for the sake of the relationship,, bUt he's a spicy kind of guy. And so while he says he's fine with not doing certain things, I can't help but wonder if the passion will decrease on his end because there's other things that he's experienced and enjoys. I want to please my man ofc and I know he's understanding, but I want to stay strong with what I believe.

Now that I was in college, I felt like I could be my 100% self. I ended up in a well-respected sorority. Most of my sisters were clearly popular in high school, and the guys we hang out with in other frats looked like they were popular too. I feel like I still am still sort of obviously awkward and I feel like they would judge me if they knew what I was like in high school.

It was 7:50 on a Sunday evening, and the dining halls closed at 8 on weekends.

‚ÄúAnything?‚Äù he asked with a sexy smirk.
 ‚ÄúI think I can whip that up.‚Äù (Y/N) thanked him once again as she stood in the cafe, awkwardly waiting for her food to be prepared. The guy came back with a to-go box in hand, flashing her a smile as he handed it to her. 
‚ÄúI hope you like what‚Äôs inside. Chef‚Äôs specialty‚Äù he said, walking back towards the kitchen, but not before turning back around to add 
‚ÄúI‚Äôm the chef by the way‚Äù, in a sultry tone. 

(Y/N) ran back to North America hall, eager to devour whatever it was that the mystery man at Cafe V had concocted for her. She opened the box and was delighted to see a chicken sandwich inside. As she lifted it up to eat she realized there was a piece of paper underneath her sandwich. Curious, she took the piece of paper to see what it could contain on it and was both surprised and flattered to find the name Harry along with a phone number on it.

I expected that and I encouraged her to share any feelings she had about other people but she insisted it was exclusive to me cause ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a disgusting pig.‚Äù Well, I was at least happy that I was honest with her. She was noticeably distant for a day, but she came to my apartment the next night. My roommate was out doing some club shit, we don‚Äôt really communicate a lot. So I answered the door and immediately notice that she was acting randy as hell. Ah ha, I am a booty call now. So I figured fuck it I‚Äôd fuck her then we‚Äôd talk about what I told her a couple days prior. We were deep into foreplay when there was a knock on my door.

I couldn‚Äôt until my gf decided to finish me off with a nice bj and man that was the best orgasm I ever had. 
After all was said and done, my gf explained to me that she is bi nut never thought to mention it to me because she was afraid I would just ask for a threesome. She said that she felt upset intitiallt when I talked to her, however the more and more she thought about me putting my dick in her friends, the hotter that idea became in her mind.

After my ex and I broke up 6 months ago, I made a resolution not to have sex indefinitely, at least for a year. In hindsight I think that was pretty arbitrary.
I just met someone on Tinder that I think is really attractive, and he is open to casual sex. Now I'm leaning towards going back on this resolution. My main concerns with casual sex are birth control, STIs and whether or not I'll develop feelings for this person. Feelings would be difficult bc he's admitted that he has multiple current partners. As for my first two concerns, I could ask him to bring a copy of a current record of an STI test to the meeting in public and make sure to tell him that using a condom is a hard limit. I told him I didn't want to have sex and that was a hard limit (even tho I'm pretty sure it's not) and I'm concerned about how he'll treat my true hard limits if I tell him I changed my mind about having sex.
Based off my messages with him, he seems like someone I can trust in a FWB situation, and he told me that he'd be open to meeting in public at a different date prior to hooking up for safety reasons (so I can make sure I'm not being catfished or preyed upon). I still know I have to be cautious tho bc I've only had a few convos with him.

Last thing, I want to keep people in my inner circle informed about my situation (roommates, family I'm comfortable discussing sex with) for safety reasons but I'm scared they're going to judge me for considering sex outside of a monogamous relationship.

A favorite thing seems to be talking about how they fit in neither of ‚Äútheir‚Äù countries, the western one they were born in and the asian one one of their parents came from, because they‚Äôre like a special child of two worlds.

That is honestly stupid.  I‚Äôm 100% Chinese.  Does that mean I‚Äôm gonna fit in more in China than in the US?  Or does that mean a black person‚Äôs gonna fit in more in Africa than whereever they grew up? 

It gives me AIDS every time they talk about this whole ‚Äúbelongs to neither side‚Äù thing as if they can only truly live if they‚Äôre surrounded with other Halfies.  I‚Äôve moved between schools with asian majorities and white majorities.  I didn‚Äôt fit in better with the asians just because they were asians.  You know what I did?  I was a normal person and I made friends based on compatible personalities and mutual interests regardless of skin color.  Like I‚Äôm not gonna be like ‚ÄúYou guys are cool but...idk you‚Äôve never had a tiger mom so I feel I can never really be your friend‚Äù

Most people get cold sores and no one makes a big deal out of it, but as you have type II, the world freaks TF out and treats you like a slut.

Then the next week when he realizes the solution set, it's a dozen lines of jargon and coding concepts that you would never even think to use unless you had a background in said language when there was no prerequisite class to learn about it.
Why the fuck am I paying tens of thousands of dollars to attend this university to take a class that tells me TO GOOGLE how to solve the god damn problem and when the professor himself DOES NOT GO OVER THE LANGUAGE IN LECTURE?

I think my partner is some kind of sociopath, or at least has sociopathic tendencies. They're a different person depending on who they're with. They aren't hurting anyone, but it's just weird how they totally different from person to person. It's like I don't know who they really are. They have a scary ability to lead conversations, throw parties, center themselves in any situation, and seem to be everywhere at once. They act really really emotional at times, and then all of a sudden, it's all gone, like it was all an act. The part that makes me the most nervous is that they never quite seem to understand how other people feel. It's like they're totally desensitized to other people's emotions. They admitted that their emotional intelligence isn't as high as most other people, and then proceeds to tell me that book knowledge helps offset it.

Careful long rant

I went through something similar but I met him through a dating app...

Now I havent completely come to grips with this situation myself but when I started using these apps it was in hopes of finding someone who I might be able to trust and start learning new things. My friend met her now boyfriend of a year because of tinder and idk it gave me hope.

I knew I was ready to have sex and didnt necessarily need someone I loved but I wanted someone I would trust and this was not the case.

I had been on these dates before and choose bumble this time bc not everyone is looking for a hook up and one night at like midnight my naive ass thought this guy legit wanted food and just to chill for a minute but it wasnt until we parked and he told me to take off my clothes I knew what was happening.

I thought before we might makeout at most and I definitely did not want it to go that far with this guy. I kept trying to push it off but I eventually gave in not knowing what to do.
He did not know I was a virgin and I never told him no but I did not enjoy it and I wish I had said no. 

I learned some things and grew from the experience I hope but I still struggle occasionally trying to find myself again. 

Anyways I blocked him after 2 weeks and am now moving on to the point Ive forgotten his name. ",,tinder,,Sun,6.0,3.0,11.903999999999998,35.64799999999998,21.69599999999999,0.077,0.764,0.159,0.98,21

At the start I was excited because I would be housing with my friends so I knew it would be a fun time. However when we started talking about possibilities and prices I started to become a little concerned. We were hoping to get a 2 bedroom apart with a loft with around 4-5 people. Hoping to not break the bank but also be able to have a single I wanted to get the loft. But when calculating the pricing for each individual I was told that I would have to pay upwards to $1200 just for the loft. I don't really find this fair as frankly I would be paying more for the loft then I would be for the master bedroom. I brought up the thought of maybe it being to high of a price but was told that it would be higher because I would be living in the loft by myself. I've seen loft pricings for around $700 and don't feel like paying almost double the amount just because i wanna live with friends. Can anyone help me with what I should do? I feel like if I bring up the $700 price ill get shot down immediately. The housing hunt is starting soon. please help me figure out what I should do.

9799,2019-03-02 23:57:08,"I really hate it when women who have been raped less times than I have tell me I have ""male privilege.""

here's my story. My mother cheated on my father several times. Then one day he decides he doesn't wanna take it anymore. So the day my father decided to confront her about it, she runs to my neighbors house, calls the police and lies to them about how he attacked her. After they release him, she divorces him, takes half of his things that she literally didn't pay a dime for (like she did not work at all the whole time they were married, not a single job or side hustle), and then uses the ""i'm a woman"" card. and so while I'm in her custody, she forces me to go to catholic church where I was molested on sundays, and left me with a babysitter who also loved little boys and raped me every other day for lets say a good 2 months. and after my mom realizes she can't fucking support us on minimum wage, she throws us back to our dad while still collecting child support for the rest of the year we're not being housed by her. and where was my male privilege in all of this? where was my dad's male privilege in all of this? 

and I'm not saying that different treatment doesn't happen. It absolutely does. There are certain things people do to women that's just not fair. And I also understand I'm an anomaly and it is often the case that women are more sexually abused than men. But there are certain things you benefit from that I as a man don't. I wish the court treated both my parents fairly instead of just automatically assuming the mother was the better parent. I wish the man had an equal say in the divorce and I wish he didn't have to give up the things that the woman didn't pay for at all. I wish the fact that she cheated several times factored into who was the more competent parent. 

but why is it not considered insensitive to automatically assume I have it better than you because I have a dick and balls? how many of you can honestly say you have been raped more times than I have whether you're a man or a woman? And furthermore how many of you can say that your rape was a result of a man being mistreated to favor the woman's side in the courtroom? I mean my dad's not a stellar parent but I can promise you I would have never been raped under his custody, but no court was willing to see that, all they were willing to see was the kind, care giving nature of a woman and the rowdy, angry nature of a man (regardless of whether it's true or not that men and women inherently have those properties).

I didn't come out of the closet strutting out in drag. I quietly opened the door and left it at that. 

Also, on the matters of the greater community, the exclusion of bi people, pan people, ace people, trans people, etc. etc. is such an awful thing to do. The issues that we as a community focus on are mostly those of cis white gay men and women. Even Gaysians buy into a lot of these problems. And when I bring any of it up, I'm the homophobe in the room. 

Sorry that I'm a gay guy that has ""straight passing"" interests, whatever the fuck that means. Sorry that I'm not a paragon for mainstream gay culture. Just because I like men, doesn't mean I need to have the same cookie-cutter personality like the rest of all y'all.

I feel like I'm working 10 or 12 hours a day, and even 5 or 6 on the weekends. My wife has been busy with her job and hasn't really been present at home. I find myself feeling lonely and depressed, much like the students on this page complain about. I guess UCSD does that to you.

Anyways, there is a student in my introductory [REDACTED] class who has been consistently coming to office hours since week 1. He was motivated to learn, but supplementing his interest in the subject was his interest in me. He had sweet, listening eyes. He would really be present with me for the entire quarter. 

About a week ago around the end of office hours, we were the only ones in the classroom. It was a night class so it was getting late, and both of us were tired and hungry. He was still asking questions, so I invited him to go to dinner with me at a restaurant near campus.  He agreed, and we ended up having a really nice time that night. 

I drove him back to the village, and he invited me to his apartment for drinks. He said his roommates had left for the weekend, so we had the place to ourselves. Against my better judgement, I agreed. My wife would probably not mind, I thought. I'm just hanging out with a cool platonic friend from work. 

After some beers, I saw the true intentions that I did not see before. They were always there, deep down. But now they are coming to the surface. Mid-sentence, I stopped talking and looked at him longingly. He looked back at me, and after a brief period of uncertain tension, went in for a kiss. It was the most exciting, passionate, intimate, and satisfying kiss I had in my life. I relaxed a bit, and it started to feel natural. I'm not going to make this post NSFW, but what happened next was a lot of really good sex. I asked him to cum in my ass and call me the ""nutty"" professor hehe.

Going home felt weird. I wanted to stay, but I knew my wife was waiting for me. I showered and cleaned myself up really well, but I felt that she knew. Should I come clean to her? I really think I might be in love with this student too, but I'm worried that he may just be using me for grades.

Senior year of high school she started dating my guy best friend, and of course it got awkward. At first I was pretty like bummed out cause I knew that it‚Äôd changed all of our friendships forever. But then I learned to be happy for them and support them no matter what. So my guy best friend and I would always do things together. Obviously that were to change once they got together. But I guess things got too awkward between my girl friend and I , and I didn‚Äôt want her to hate me so I would push my guy friend away. Like all the time. And the few times where I needed him there or he‚Äôd asked to hang out I felt as if my girl friend was just secretely starting to hate me. Apparently she does hate me now. She started ignoring me, stopped hitting me up, she doesn‚Äôt look or approach me when we make eye contact in person (walking to class). She goes to UCSD and so does our other girl friend (my roommate), but she only approached her when I‚Äôm not around.  and the times I‚Äôve gone back home on the weekends she decides to visit my roommate. I knew things were getting rocky, which is why I cut off my guy best friend, even after he said that all of our friendships should still be okay. I lost 2 best friends. I‚Äôm sure this is normal but it hurts. I feel like I can‚Äôt talk about it to anyone. I think what hurts me the most is that I‚Äôve gone through hell and back this year. I had two family members pass away in a span of a week, one which I had to keep visiting at the hospital for over a month before her passing, this year has been really tough, and I didn‚Äôt have any of them there for me. Shouldn‚Äôt she have been there for me ? Knowing that we had 12+ Years of friendship on the line. I wasn‚Äôt asked how I was doing, I wasn‚Äôt supported through the process of having family members ill, let alone when they passed. And I hate that I cut my guy best friend off too because he‚Äôs literally been there for me for 6+ years. I hate to say it but I feel like I‚Äôm starting to be angry at her for not being there, for cutting me off, I just hate all of this. I think the major thing is that during the time my family member was in the hospital, I had to be going home a lot, and there was times my family couldn‚Äôt pick me up.. and she would drive back home and wouldn‚Äôt even try to ask if I needed a ride. That broke me so many times because I just wanted to be back home with my family. I feel like if she would‚Äôve been a part of my life, so much could‚Äôve gone different, I wouldn‚Äôt be feeling this. But anyways did I do something wrong ?

Also, NSFW just in case. IDK if you want to read this while you're working... It's gonna be a long boi. No structure really, just me ranting: a flow of thoughts if you will

She just got a boyfriend. Cool huh? Issue is that she never told us. We learned like a month or two after the fact. What? This is kinda important you know... Instead you scare the living crap after us by telling us, ""We need to talk."" God I thought you were dying or in a hospital or got hit my a car, but nope. ""I got a boyfriend.""

Fun fact: I knew the day after they got together because a friend told me she saw her with the guy kissing... Hm...

Now I haven't met him, but I know someone that has. She told me that he's kinda an asshole.  He doesn't really ask permission to do anything, so he gives her hickeys, to the point where she's bleeding from the neck. We approached her cause we saw it, but she doesn't mind!? Bruh, you're bleeding, that ain't fine. Also stop asking us to help cover your blood stains and the red marks up, not my fault you didn't say no to them... And what? You started to get hickeys THE DAY YOU GOT TOGETHER? BOI. TAKE YOUR TIME

This is the problem with her. She's really clueless about love, relationships, etc. I took normal, non-AP, psychology in high school and I think I know more about love than her. They met, got together, started the hickey train, and the PDA in TWO WEEKS. What the fuck? No dates? No ""getting coffee and talking?"" No ""making sure he isn't a murder or a fuckboi?"" What the hell? How do you even know if the two of you are compatible? 

She's also really really submissive. She saids ""no"" but he just does it regardless and she doesn't even flinch. Okay then... What happened to ""no means no?"" What? I don't mind if he grabs you, hugs you, kisses you, cuddles, etc., but not in front of us... Having people see your PDA is awkward, we feel awkward and everyone else feels awkward sitting next to a couple making out... Hell, the professor in comm even commented about it...

I also found out they've been doing ""third base"" stuff. What? She isn't the type of person to do that, and knowing her, she wouldn't of allowed it 6 months ago. As far as I know, she wasn't into that life. What? They're already touching other sexually? I don't even wanna know if they've ""done it"" yet... God that's nasty to even think about. 

And he goes ""look, I lowered her rice purity score by 50!"" AND SHE'S PROUD OF IT. WHAT. THE. FUCK.

*sigh* ok. 

What caused you to change my friend? I didn't know you had this latent ""whore"" in you. Is it a way to cope with your parents' suppression? Is it you coping with how much your parents spoiled you, or how much better your younger sibling is than you? What happened? I know we aren't even really good friends -- hell, I'm 99% sure you don't even like me as a friend -- but I care about you like any other friend. You don't even talk to us anymore... Are you ok?

I was driving once and came THIS close to rear ending someone because of two beautiful planets (in the words of the sage Jasonius Derulus) gracefully moving down the street. 

I always thought it was just my immature sense humor to like a song about butts. Still, I sometimes wonder if there's some correlations going on here. Despite my six-year-old prepubescence (i.e. no development of libido yet) was I drawn to the song because on top of my current lust for booties they also have a base aesthetic appeal to me? Or maybe it was some prepubescent lust that initially enticed me about the song and I just lacked the experience at that point to recognize arousal.

Another line of thinking could be my later development of attraction to ample back sides was actually caused by my choice of song.

9624,2019-02-27 00:46:04,"I find it difficult to fit in with people my age. As cliche as this may sound, I personally believe I was born in the wrong era. I was born in Asia and raised almost solely by my grandparents until I was 4, although they continued to look after me until my early teenage years. They're truly wonderful people and I'm proud to say that they (alongside my single mother and my biological uncle who I call my dad) raised me right (as far as I'm concerned) but the downside is that I've absorbed a lot of their mannerisms and viewpoints. While I know which beliefs and points of views to discard as they are wholly inappropriate for today's day and age, enough of their influence on me remain to this day to where I believe I am a middle aged man (at least) in a 19 year old guy's body. Consequently, it's hard for me to make too many friends or find very many romantic interests. In no particular order, here's a list of my characteristics and experiences that lead me to that conclusion (for lack of a better way to introduce this list):

- Throughout middle and high school, I've successfully befriended a number of my teachers and sometimes found their company more enjoyable than that of some of my peers.
- Very down-to-earth 
- Big history and politics nut. Absolutely can't care for and can do without pop culture (at least modern pop culture).
- I generally consider an intellectual, a highbrow person (to a fault)
- Quite behind on the sayings and memes of today. Didn't know what a 'dumpster fire' was (besides a literal fire in a dumpster) until about two months or so ago.
- While I watch people play a variety of video games on YouTube, I am not in any way shape or form a gamer myself.
- I don't have Netflix or Hulu and I genuinely do not recognize them as being legitimate competitors (with regards to their output) to television.
- For me, TV today is crap with too many commercials and too much gratuitous sex and violence. Same goes for movies today. I just find TV 
and movies from yesteryear far better and more entertaining in many ways.
- In regards to TV, I'm a big fan of informative programs (in depth news programs, the news in general, etc. from yesteryear and today) and light entertainment, shit like game shows and comedy programs (panel shows, improv, satire, topical stuff; so shows like Mock the Week from the UK and Whose Line from both the UK and US if you want an idea)
- I generally watch TV shows and movies from at least 30 years ago, if not more.
- I generally don't do animation except for things that make me feel nostalgic (SpongeBob, most of the stuff from early 2010s Nickelodeon and Cartoon Network, The Simpsons, and a few other things). I have never watched anime (nor do I have any desire or interest to) and Disney films are meh to me. I feel like I've outgrown them. 
- I don't care for EDM or rap or most of the rubbish they put on radio nowadays, which puts me at odds with about 95% of this campus and people my age (in my opinion). I'm a big classic rock fan. Love the Beatles (Sgt. Pepper's onwards) although I don't have any other particular bands that I like. I like individual songs more than bands. My music collection is comprised of rock from the '60s to the '90s along with some disco, new wave, instrumental/easy listening, and other things.
- My philosophy when it comes to what I watch and listen to boils down to two main ideas: a) I like what I like and b) I don't care what the hell people listen to/watch these days, if you're really as good as people claim you are, I'll hear about you again in 30 years time and I'll see/watch you then.
- I was taught to respect hierarchy wherever it exists, which makes it hard for me to mix in with the (very active) leadership of the org I'm involved in and get to know them as people. I see them as my superiors rather than as my peers and fellow humans and consequently, I feel that it's improper to pursue anything else but a good working relationship with them. This is in spite of having attended multiple house parties with them where I witnessed them getting absolutely blitzed and consequently got to learn the most incredible and personal things about them.
- My idea of a fun time with friends is around a table with drinks and/or good food and just chatting and laughing the night away in solid conversation. No need for loud music or shouting or a darkened room with flashing lights or drunkenness.
- I am not a clubber. Never envision myself going out clubbing at any time ever. Can't stand club music (specifically it's loudness), generally don't like the club scene, or staying out into the wee hours of the morning.
- Tries to finish all my work so I can sleep by midnight or 1 at the latest.
- Still a defender of the notion that chivalry isn't dead, of treating everyone with kindness and respect irrespective of who/what they are in relation to you, of loyalty and commitment to family, friends, romantic partners, etc. 
- Still explicitly asks girls out on a ""date"", still a believer in giving flowers and chocolates just because, still a believer in true love 
- Similarly, I absolutely do not believe in Tinder. Don't have one, don't intend on making one. I'm looking for something real and enduring. I don't have the time or energy for casual flings or one time hookups.
- Similarly, I don't have the time or energy for fake people and fake friends. Consequently, my circle of friends is relatively small.
- I genuinely believe we (our generation) need to physically interact with each other more and learn to love each other more. We need to stop being so shallow. We need to have more genuine human connection
- I've been told by a variety of people in my life that I act more maturely than the average person of my age. I believe that I'm more mature than a lot of people myself. I do not believe I am anywhere near the most mature being ever, but certainly above average. I know it sounds like I'm tooting my own horn, but judging by what others tell me and from what I believe, I think it's true.
- I have very little patience for immaturity and childish behavior. I'm allergic to bullshit and stupidity (despite possessing the capability to be stupid myself sometimes)
- I look and sound older than I actually am. 

And I think that's about it. 

Essentially, the tl;dr version of all of this is that I have antiquated and unconventional tastes in just about everything when compared to the average 19 year old college kid and it's hard for me to fit in with many people my age. 

I know the list kinda makes me sound like an conceited arrogant bastard, but I swear to you I'm not. I'm not trying to toot my own horn nor am I complaining exactly, I just felt the need to unload, and you know, this has been rather therapeutic to me, it's taken a load off my chest. Feel free to leave your thoughts (or not). If you made it this far (through the whole list), congratulations, you've reached the end. Give yourself a choccy.

There was this intense rush from the thought that somebody I knew (like hot guys) would be getting off to me, and I became one of the most popular posters on there. Eventually, I realized it would be worth it to monetize, so I started selling panties and while that was some nice extra spending money, I decided to take the leap to actually camming. I'm on one of the more popular sites and I rotate between that and another if there aren't a lot of viewers. I've been making around 2-3k a month extra just by spending a few hours on the weekends (and weeknights if no midterms) just masturbating on camera, I almost forget its there I just occasionally reply to the chat.

9598,2019-02-26 14:41:47,"It's a sad day when you find out that a person you used to date has removed you from their instagram. Idk why it hit me so hard but it just did. Being essentially erased from her life just by a click of a button on a screen. She was my longest and happiest relationship and we had to part ways while we still had feelings for one another. Our entire relationship was long distance and that coupled with me studying abroad for 1/2 a year led to us to come to the decision that maybe it's best, and more logical that we part ways. The part that hurt the most was the part where I had to hug her goodbye as I whispered to her, ""Thank you for the past year and 8 months"". *Kissed one last time* and she then got out of my car and walked back to her home. By far the hardest break up I've ever had to experience. Sometimes I'd like to think that is the reason why I'm not afraid to shoot my shot for anyone I'm interested in now, because nothing will hurt me as bad as that. I'm not sure where I'm going with this story, I was just letting my thoughts flow through my fingers. But don't worry about me. I believe I'm emotionally resilient. It's never a matter of ""if"" I'll be okay, but rather a ""when"" I'll be okay. I guess I just miss being in a relationship more today. Having someone to tell my day to, having someone's hand to hold, someone's forehead to kiss, someone's hair to smell after she takes a shower. The little things you know.

All those times I wished the circumstances were different and I wasn‚Äôt the person I was back then. I don‚Äôt spontaneously cry or anything like that, but I‚Äôm very prone to making myself feel emotionally hurt. For the regretful things, it‚Äôs always something minor, like how I may come off a little bit savage or self-deprecate myself when joking around with friends. I try to make myself as amicable as possible, and sometimes it worked, but more often than not I end up hating myself for it in the future. In my mind, I‚Äôm always thinking of when I meet and get to know someone reasonably well, I‚Äôm setting myself up for disappointment later for the most minor things that I think most people forget about. Like, how one of my friends didn‚Äôt do too well on a midterm and I made a rude comment about it. I‚Äôm sure he didn‚Äôt hear it or he probably forgot it ever happened, but I still remember the moment very clearly and I continue to hate myself for it. I may seem emotionally weak or something, but I guess that‚Äôs the price I paid to be so sensitive to everyone‚Äôs feelings and words. 

I remember this one time where I was in a car with some friends. I think the person who said the comment forgot, but I still remember the exact words of how it would be everything would be a bit more entertaining without me.

On the inside, I get this person‚Äôs intention and I know this person didn‚Äôt mean to do anything wrong, but it‚Äôs moments like these that I can‚Äôt help but constantly reflect upon and hate myself for not being a different person, I guess.

I keep asking myself if I‚Äôm a bad person for being capable of understanding other people‚Äôs emotions and intentions so well that I end up every comment to heart so much that it ends up hurting me. I made the mistake of hurting (and losing) past friends by making certain comments, even if they were never meant to hurt. I always apologized afterwards, but I can‚Äôt help but dwell on those moments. I vowed never to hurt anyone like that ever again.

I'd love to be in this field after graduation and am currently engaging in substantial hands-on experiences in it as well. Everyone says that its booming but undergrads don't seem to get any opportunities in this. I am a sophomore and even juniors for the most part haven't gotten any Data Science Internships (to my knowledge). And I am not sure if I even have the skills for SWE Internships either, as it seems I have limited myself in my ""range of capabilities and expertise"". 

I have also been told (both directly and indirectly) that I am rejected solely coz I am a sophomore or an undergrad and although being a junior might increase my chances, even to get in at that time I'd probably require prior internships to distinguish myself from the crowd. And its also too risky at that time as it may come down to the wire; make or break. I believe I have a strong application and a strong GPA, have attended several recruitment events and have interviewed with several companies as well (including a couple recognizable brands and big companies), but to no avail. I also know lots of people in the same situation as me, so its definitely not an 'individual' problem either.

Doesn't mean I have given up, I am still trying out. But I am really scared and starting to feel demotivated.

Both times I talked to the advisor Jeffery Saikali and both times have been the worst advising experience I've ever had. Jeffery constantly talks down to you and makes you feel bad for basically every question you ask and every decision you plan on making. Every time I've gone in and talked with him I came out with knowing slightly more information, none of which actually pertaining to what I went in for though.

My freshman year I went in to ask what my chances were of transferring in to the Math department since it was recently impacted. I walk in, sit down and start asking questions. He interrupts me and says ""Typically when people meet they introduce themselves"", how am I supposed to know you don't have my info pulled up on your screen, I checked in after all. After I finally get to asking questions, he then started telling me how math wouldn't be a good fit and how I shouldn't try since my lower div math grades weren't good. When, I told him I was wanting to transfer to get into Math/CS, he looked again at my transcript, saw the straight A's I got in my current CS classes and still told me that I shouldn't try. Remember, I was asking just what my chances were. Not only did I get approved to transfer in, but I was able to pull some amazing grades too in both math and computer science upper div courses.

Now in my junior year, I wanted to go into advising for schedule planning, since the new degree audit confused me. I walk in, realize it's the same POS I had two years ago. I offer my hand to shake and say ""Hi, I'm OP"", you know, because when people meet you introduce yourself right? He looks at my hand, and makes a fist for a fist bump??? Fuck you too. I ask questions and say that I need help with schedule planning. He not once helped me pick the classes I wanted to take in the future, just pointed me to the list that's on the degree audit saying I can take these courses. The whole time he was talking condescendingly and making me feel guilty for even coming in.

If you go in for math advising and get told to go to Jeffery Saikali's office, ask if you can go to someone else's. If you can't, just leave you'll be better off.

I just want to tell you that you were wrong for over generalizing the space and clumping everyone into a single category. Just like many other orgs, KP has its owns pros and cons and to single out KP was just plain wrong. KP definitely provides a community for Fil-Ams and many felt/feels supported by this org and KP has retained them throughout undergrad. However, I will not deny that toxicity within the board space and the community do exists. You were right about instances when problems do not get solved because some people simply do not like to tackle the problem and likes to beat around the bush causing the problem to escalate and worsen. There are instances when it can be clique-y as well. As someone who's been in the space, I admit that there were times when I felt both supported AND unsupported. KP has its problems internally and that's the truth. I personally think that one of the biggest issues is that members of KP tend to deny this fact and do not want to tackle this issue and have a conversation on how we can make the space better. While I agree with those who commented on the original post defending KP, I think it's also important that we also recognize our own faults and work towards making the space better.

9366,2019-02-17 23:37:51,"I‚Äôm really considering getting some airpods but I‚Äôm still a little unsure.
Am I going to look like I have some funny straws coming out of me?

But most importantly, I am thinking about them because I found out I can pair them with my android device and I would love to have some stable wireless buds on me. 

I would trust apple airpods to not break on my through normal usage and other general apple products because they maintain their value overtime. That being said, I got the new ipad pro so I could do schoolwork on the go and maintain that tablet style (I also got the keyboard and pencil). I would use my computer but it‚Äôs a little clunky and has way too many processes going on at the same time (and it‚Äôs not SSD, so the fan can be a little loud and embarrassing for me). So I have this tablet because it‚Äôs something that really won‚Äôt slow down on me for a very long time, even with a bunch of processes going on. I won‚Äôt be using much space on this since it is just schoolwork and I suppose games (I currently don‚Äôt have any on here), but I don‚Äôt expect storage usage to go up a lot, nor do I expect to run out. Anyway, I needed consistent fast process to do school stuff so I got it.

So yeah, I think airpods would benefit me for both my devices, but I would like some more opinions. Also, I heard apple would be releasing second gen airpods, and idk if I should wait an undetermined amount of time (end of 2019) or get them now and hope I can trade them in for a cheaper airpods 2 cost? Is that something I can do?

My plan is to get them from the bookstore and I was hoping I can trade them in whenever airpods 2 comes out?

9299,2019-02-13 21:26:40,"Hi guys. I've been a member of this group for a while now and have tried to help as many people as I can. Now it's your turn to help me out. 

(BTW, sorry if this post is a bit long)

I am interested in this lady who is a member of an org that I am also a part of. She is a very beautiful soul (and a very beautiful person in general); strong but emotionally sensitive with a zeal for life, an intellectual with similar interests to my own, and so very passionate about the org and the people in it. We don't know each other very well or are very close since she spent fall quarter away from UCSD and I've only known her since the start of this quarter (also, I'm relatively new to the org, having joined earlier this school year). 

Anyways, there are a couple issues. First, I seem to forget how to work my vocal cords to produce intelligible English whenever I approach her.  I get so nervous around her that I absolutely lose my train of thought and my ability to make conversation (something I'm generally good at). This has never happened to me before in the past (at least with my recent interests). Second, it's difficult for me to be able to engage her anyway, since she's always flanked by her friends/org-mates before, during, and after these meetings (although we are connected on social media). Third, for reasons that are unclear to me, I don't get along very well with one of her really close friends and I'm afraid that this may lead to future complications. Fourth, she holds a leading position in the org, which may or may not cause problems if I go for it. And fifth, we don't have any classes together, so we only see each other at org meetings a couple times a week for a couple hours each time (with most of that time being dedicated to club-related activities).  

To complicate matters further, I'm planning to leave the org soon to pursue other endeavors. In fact, if I had alternative means to reach out and connect with her, I probably would've already left. She's a year older than I am and graduating at the end of this school year and I feel like if I don't shoot my shot soon, I never will be able to shoot. My goose will be cooked and ready for serving, essentially.

So all I'm asking from you fine people is for some (serious) advice, words of encouragement, or any form of serious input really. I truly appreciate it. Thanks.",,"serious, long",,Wed,21.0,9.0,108.03999999999975,124.53799999999968,90.9580000000001,0.057,0.767,0.177,0.9955,21

9223,2019-02-09 13:13:37,"To the OP hung up on girl for 5+ years:

It's because you may have the delusion that there is still a chance despite whatever you might be telling yourself.

You have to accept that it's over and mourn over the loss. Rip the band-aid off. Remove all traces of her from your life: Facebook, Snapchat, other social media, personal pictures, texts, block her calls/texts. Then the mourning (healing) can begin. Once it's over, you'll be happy and move on.

Be honest to yourself: do you think she's longed for you at all in these last 5 years? You're wasting all this time and energy on just this one chick, that you totally could've just met someone else and have been happy instead.

I've been in your shoes, though I was only hung up on the girl for the 3 years we knew each other. I made a move about 1 year into the friendship but it blew up in my face. I held out for the remaining 2, hoping that somehow i would get her to be my gf.

The relationship evolved into an unhealthy one (a little toxic even) and the only thing that ended up happening is that I was used, and not in a sexy way either, but in a more like doing-her-homework-being-a-complete-doormat way. 

Towards the end I tried being just a friend, but realized I was trying to fool myself into believing I could be friends with someone I still had deep feelings for. I was miserable because I knew I could never be more than just a friend, that she was better off without me, etc. etc. (sound familiar?)

I ended up just focusing on my studies instead, forgetting everything about dating and the bullshit that comes with it, graduating, getting a good job, and enjoying the shit out of life. Cutting her out of my life hurt like hell, because I was really in love with her... 

it was the best thing I could've done for myself.

The most important lesson to be learned is not to put every crush on a fucking pedestal. They are a crush, they were never anything to you beyond just a crush. You liking them intensely is not going to make them like you back. Learn how to be shot down like a champ, and move on.

life is too beautiful my dude, and there's plenty of fish and all that jazz.

I hang out in the common room a lot, since my roommate is always home when I am and I need some space. Unfortunately, the couple's room shares a wall with it. As a result, their lovemaking is easily overheard and they are LOUD (you can hear all the skin slapping and bed frame shaking, to the point where they might as well leave the door open.) 

It appears that they are completely oblivious to this and I am not the type of person who can bring up grievances comfortably.

Normally, without restriction or binging, we‚Äôre talking the doctor recommended 2000 calories a day with exercise during the week, my weight levels out in a weird place. For my height, I naturally stay at a BMI of 24 (for the friends who don‚Äôt know that‚Äôs just under being classified as overweight which is a BMI of over 25). I could never figure out why eating and exercising normally still leaves me at just under overweight. So I started working out more intensely and seriously watching what I eat and constantly paying attention to restricting calories. I‚Äôve been maintaining/ losing weight and it‚Äôs great! But the amount of caloric restriction necessary to force my body to lose weight is crazy (like people and parents worry crazy). Also the amount I think about food and restriction is pretty all consuming. Get it? ;) I‚Äôve been feeling an odd mix of maybe trying to get help for my developed food obesession, but I know if I‚Äôm told to eat normally I‚Äôll just gain weight again which I really don‚Äôt want to happen. Is it wrong to almost enjoy having an eating disorder because weight loss made me feel more confident? I know this cannot be good for my mental health but with my weight in check and having good blood pressure and good grades I really feel like obsessing is helping me.

I am an international student but I am not from China. Lets just stop assuming all i ternational are from china. Anyway, I sometimes feel embarassed telling friends that I am paying out of state tuition. whenever the conversation comes up I will immediately try to avoid it or at point lie that I am not out of state because it seems that ,too many, the amount I pay is just an exorbant amount and it doesnt make sense to pay that much. I totally agree, Of course If I had the choice I wouldnt want to pay that much also. But also because of this, my lifestlye changed and I become frugal because people around me are frugal. I like it so far, especially because I managed to save a lot of my monthly pocket money that my parents send me. 

However, sometimes I just feel the need to splurge. I would like to go back to days back home where everyone of my friends spends $1000+ a night on fancy food drinks clubbing and that is the norm.

But I think I scared her (i'm easily double her size and have been called scary looking with my rbf) because she started walking faster and then put her keys between her knuckles, which left me in the awkward position of either speeding up to pass her (am I chasing her down in the dark?) or slowing down (that's probably creepier) all about 10-15 ft behind her at this point.

Labon and Palmilla Dr bus stop students, it is raining and the line is long. I'm sure everybody knows where the line starts! When there is a HUGE line, it's very rude to cut everybody in line and go to the front, even if you live closer around IG. The line flows from the bus stop to around the corner FOR A REASON. The bus stops at the front, so if you stop at the front, you are getting in first. Normally when the 202 bus can fit everybody, it is still bad, but at least we can make it to school. When 4 full busses pass, and you get on before everyone else who has been waiting bus after bus, that is very wrong to just cut int the front! I would tell you to go to the back of the line, but since I was at the back, I could not go to the front. SO PEOPLE AT THE FRONT WHO MADE IT THERE, DO YOUR PART AND TELL THEM THAT THE END OF THE LINE IS OVER THERE BACK. If not for yourself, do it for the people who have been waiting bus after bus. 
The reason this needs to be addressed is because there was a line today, and because of ONE or TWO people, THE LINE WAS GROWING THE OTHER WAY. IT SNOWBALLS. So people who got here last, who don't know where the end of the line is, are at the beginning, and they get on the bus first! This doesn't make sense, just go to the back of the line. I come from the IG side, and I know it is unfair the end of the line is farther away, but you can't do anything about the fact that the bus runs the way it does. It stops at the first person at the bus stop. so logically the end is the OTHER side. ",,,,Tue,0.0,4.0,52.92000000000004,54.0,79.272,0.09,0.889,0.021,-0.9621,09

So this is a lot for me to share. I don‚Äôt really feel like I can talk to anyone about it. I am a gay man and I use Grindr (big shocker). My freshmen year I hooked up with this guy off Grindr and it was pretty hot. Let‚Äôs call him jack. I hooked up with him four more times over the past two years. The more I hung out with him, the more I realize jack was a shitty human being so I blocked him on Grindr. He then proceeded to make new accounts and tell me that he was going to find me and rape me. I was scared so I stopped using Grindr for a while. I downloaded it again today and this guy wanted to hook up. He was hot so I was down. I got to his place and turns out it was jack the whole time. He told me that all he wanted to do was talk. I was scared out of my mind and I felt like I was going to be killed. I listened to him ramble about how disrespectful I was, and how he thinks about me all the time. I told him I wanted to leave. Jack said he wanted to have sex with me one last time. I told him I didn‚Äôt want to. He told me that if I didn‚Äôt have sex with him, he was going to leak all my explicit photos all over ucsd and that he would keep pursuing me. If I had sex with him, then I would never see him again. I decided to have sex with him to get it over with. I wanted this to end.  I cried during it. He didn‚Äôt care. I just left his place.

I‚Äôm a girl and recently I absolutely hate being a girl. Ever since I was a kid I wished I was a boy since boy things and activities were cooler. I wear men‚Äôs shirts and glasses a lot since I like them more. Also I never want kids; the idea of getting pregnant with a child makes me want to vomit and is disgusting to me (if you are a woman who wants to have kids I completely understand that I‚Äôm the anomaly here and I don‚Äôt mean expressing my discomfort with an idea to offend anyone). In general everything about being female is meant for reproduction. Having boobs and an ass so men will want to f*ck you, having larger hips so you can have a baby, keeping extra fat on your body so you can have a baby, menstrating every month so you can have a baby, having boobs (Again) so you can feed your baby; every single god damn thing about a girl is just so she can be a fuck toy or have babies and I hate it. I wish I didn‚Äôt feel like the female gender was so useless and only exists for a purpose that makes gag thinking about it. And I hate to feel this way. I don‚Äôt want to hate being a girl. Additionally, I‚Äôm not trans, I identify as female and do not want to medically or otherwise transition to male. I just wish that I could get my tubes tied or something since I don‚Äôt want to get pregnant ever and getting my period every month has been so horrible that I‚Äôve been on birth control before I even turned 13. I hate the things the female body does on its own just for sake of fertility. It sucks. I hate being a girl but I don‚Äôt have dysphoira and I‚Äôm not trans. I‚Äôm stuck. I don‚Äôt know how to fix feeling this much hate towards my own existence. Any advice would be welcome. Thank you for reading.

Okay so I get a call from a person claiming to be in SGS, and a lot of signs say that this person is a fraud. So I do the rational thing, I call up SGS. So first I call up the department in my own hometown, and those mother fuckers do not answer but that's okay. 

So then I call up the one closest to the area code of his phone number (which was in New Jersey), and I explain to her my situation. and she tells me ""if you don't have the name of the person I can't help you"". so then I just ask ""well wait a minute, can you answer me if you use hellosignon becuase I was emailed this"" and then the dumb bitch fucking hangs up! 

And NOW I'M REALLY FUCKING PISSED. but you know what, that's okay. I call back the person in question. I get his name. I talk to him, sort out some of the suspicion, but I am still not willing to take his word for it because taht's the rational thing to do. So I call back SGS and the BITCH JUST HANGS UP ON ME ON THE FIRST RING. LIKE SERIOUSLY FUCK YOU! I TRIED TO BE AS COOPERATIVE AS YOU FUCKING CAN AND THEN YOU FUCKING HANG UP ON ME WITHOUT EVEN GIVING ME A CHANCE YOU UNPROFSSIONAL PIECE OF SHIT BITCH MOTHERFUCKER WORTHLESS SHIT FOR BRAINS JACK ASS!!

So then I get my vip phone with a fake phone number. call them up. and no surprise they do pick up. and I kindly explain the situation, give them the name, and then tehy go search it. and guess what they do? instead of letting me know whether this is legitmate or not, THEY FUCKING HANG UP ON ME AGAIN!!!!!!! LIKE FUCK THESE PEOPLE. DON'T THEY KNOW WHAT THE FUCK THEIR JOB IS?? YOUR JOB IS TO ANSWER THE FUCKING PHONE AND HELP PEOPLE. I DID MY FUCKING PART. I BROUGHT THE GODDAMN FUCKING NAME YOU ASKED FOR. AND KEEP IN MIND THROUGHOUT ALL OF THESE CALLS, I WAS CIVIL. I DIDN'T SWEAR, I DIDN'T CALL NAMES, I WAS VERY FUCKING GODDAMN PROFESSIONAL AND THIS FUCKING DUMB BITCH CAN'T RECIPROCATE THAT. FUCKING HATE YOU SGS.

but see I had the benefit of the doubt .I find that they have another office in New Jersey with the exact same area code as the person who calls me. so i figure i'd give them one last chance and call sgs in that office and guess what. THE FUCKING BITCH ISN'T THERE TO PICK UP THAT PHONE EITHER. AND IT's FUCKING NEW JERSEY TIME THERE IS NO WAY BOTH CALIFORNIA AND NEW JERSEY ARE HAVING LUNCH AT THE SAME FUCKING TIME BECAUSE THEY ARE 3 FUCKING HOURS AHEAD.

And there have been confessions by girls lately that they feel there is something wrong with them because they don't get catcalled/feel like they don't get enough male attention...look, I understand. If men find you attractive, they treat you like a fucktoy/make creepy advances, and if they don't find you attractive, they treat you like trash/actively disrespect you, if you're not ""fuckable"" to them, clearly you don't deserve basic human decency.

(But seriously being catcalled isn't fun either, but men definitely treat women they want to fuck better than ones they deem ""ugly"")

Can men just treat us like human beings instead of fucking ""mystical mysteries"" or disrespecting us? I know it's apparently news, but you can treat even those you don't want to fuck with decency.

I am currently a first year who lives on campus, but due to extenuating circumstances, I doubt that my family and I will even be able to afford off-campus housing even though it is significantly cheaper than on-campus (probably starting this spring quarter). My family is not particularly low-income, so I receive enough financial aid to cover the tuition of UCSD, but that's it. However, due to extenuating family circumstances (Long-term expensive hospital care for a family member), housing would be an extra burden (despite it probably being around 700 dollars/month) according to my research, and my family can not afford to take out any more loans. However, I do predict that I would receive enough financial aid to cover tuition (but nothing else) for the next three years.

Therefore, I just want to talk to a ""veteran"" homeless UCSD student who has advice on how they planned for it, where they sleep, if they have a car (and if so, where they keep it), what they eat, and other misc info (stuff like commuter lockers and showers at the gym).

An unfortunate student wearing airpods and riding a bird scooter was his first victim. I remember his cries as Shaggy picked him up and examined this new prey. 

""OH GOD, I'VE GOT AIRPODS ON, I CAN'T HEAR YOU! I DON'T SPEAK BROKE!"" the student cried, but Shaggy ignored his rambling and swallowed him whole (much to my relief). However, Shaggy was still hungry, and he locked his eyes onto me, his next target. 

I did the only thing that any sweaty CS nerd who hasn't showered in 5 weeks would do.

I ran back to my reshall. 

I ran fast, the fear of Shaggy still fresh on my mind. After what felt like an eternity of running, I finally made it to the door and shut myself inside of my bedroom, hoping that I lost him. Shaggy was not to be deterred. Within a few seconds, his Ultra Instinct has guided him straight to my reshall. There was no escape.

I trembled in fear as I heard the footsteps coming closer. 

""He's here!"" I audibly gasped. ""Oh god he's here... Shaggy is coming to the reshalls to SWALLOW me whole!"" I turned to the only beacon of help in this forsaken dorm - my body pillow of the one and only Gillespie-sama. 

I wept, for the end was near, and fell to my knees. Tears came down my cheeks as I clasped my hands together and prayed ""Please save me, Gary-sama."" 

It was no use, the footsteps came closer and closer to the door of the reshall, and I could hear a loud ZOINKS! as the door came flying off its hinges. ""This is how it ends."" I thought to myself. Shaggy's fist made a hole in my bedroom door, and his menacing visage followed. At that moment, I thought all was lost.

At that moment, a miracle happened. Gary Gillespie came bursting through the window, with his knife in one hand and the keys to a Lexus in the other. 

The atmosphere was intense. Shaggy stared at Gary, but Gary returned his gaze. 
""How unprofessional of you, Shaggy-san,"" Gary laughed. ""I thought after our battle ten years ago that you would learn not to attack my worshippers. Since you have broken this matter of principle, I shall deduct professionalism from your body.""

Shaggy didn't reply, his murderous eyes were fixed on Gary's. All of a sudden, Shaggy lunged for Gary's throat. 

""Watch out Gary-sama!"" I cried, but Gary was quicker. He ducked and grabbed Shaggy by his green shirt. 

""NANI THE HELL GARY BRO?"" Shaggy cried, dumbfounded. Gary didn't hesitate and deducted 100% professionalism from Shaggy. 

""Unfortunately for you Shaggy-chan, it's a sad situation"", Gary spoke triumphantly, and smashed Shaggy's body, dignity, and dining dollars to bits with his mustache. 

I gazed in awe at my savior, Gillespie-sama, and once again fell to my knees before him. ""Rise, my child"" Gary spoke. I looked up at his holy figure. His eyes shone brightly of a CS major who hasn't slept in two weeks. ""Thank you for acting professionally"" he spoke, and ran off into the night, Shaggy's blood still fresh on his clothes.

So I had a date tonight. I met her online, we talked for at least a week, had a bunch of weirdly-specific common interests, and were enthusiastic about meeting up. She especially wanted to meet me, an had suggested seeing a show. So I bought tickets and we did. Admittedly, I was a little late, but I apologized profusely and she seemed cool with it. That was my only real fuck up. Anyway, due to the nature of the music (Indie rock), it went on until late and was fairly loud the whole time-we're weren't able to talk much. Then, I weirdly ended up seeing a couple friends from my HS (I'm from SD so it occasionally happens) so I talked with them for a hot couple minutes. After the show, I suggested getting some drinks or food...and she said she was tired. I kinda knew at that point, but she then flip-flopped and agreed to go to this small restaurant open late. So she then ends up standing me up there and lies saying that she was certain it was closed. As I'm there with a table. I apologize again for this apparently horrible date and ask if we could go on a better ""talking"" date to get to know each other. She refuses (I'll give her that she was polite about it) citing that I'm ""too extroverted and sociable"" for her. First off, I'm confused since I go to UCSD-I should be auto-classified as an introvert. Two, how did you judge my character after absolutely zero real conversations with me?! I'm not even mad she didn't want to date me, I'm just pissed that she judged me super rudely and didn't give me a chance. And of course, maybe she didn't find me attractive in person which is completely valid. Although it is a bit ironic coming from a person who was a good 25lbs heavier in person! And yet I didn't judge her. I gave her a chance to be beyond just a body. And I'm stuck with feeling a mix of anger at her judgement, and sadness that I offended/ strongly put her off somehow.

I'm a transfer and I have one more quarter and if none of them get approved I'll have to take five classes for Spring quarter. I just feel like not many of the counselors here are that great, at least not for sixth college. The art department is ok with counseling but have made some mistakes before that would have made me not graduate on time if I hadn't caught them. Not to mention I almost had to take freshman core sequence even though I came in as a junior. Sometimes it really seems like the counselors' jobs is to get the school more money and not help the students. The only reason that I'm graduating on time is because of all of the hard work and planning I did to make sure I can. It's just that everything takes forever and I've been given false information numerous times. Sometimes I don't even know why we have counselors considering I've had to do everything. I don't mind doing things myself but when you specifically set up an appointment and spend time to go see someone who is supposed to help you and then you are given information that isn't accurate it just makes things worse than they would have been if there weren't any counselors at all.

For a long time I‚Äôve toyed with my bisexuality. Am I bisexual and I not, only one way to find out...

I download Grindr, I literally just download open the app make an account and all of a sudden I am greated with a barrage of dick pics. 

Bear in mind I haven‚Äôt even added any fotos or a bio.

Everyone talks about straight privilege, but honestly hookups are so incredibly easy being gay. I could fuck a guy every single day of the year with minimal effort. Being straight on the other hand a few times a month if I‚Äôm lucky. 

Anyway so I agree to meet with this guy. He sent a dick I was kinda weirded out but it ended up working I‚Äôm his favour I guess. I can see why girls hate unsolicited dicks pics so much.

So I get in his car, we chat for a bit. I know how to flirt with girls but with guys it‚Äôs kinda weird. I was at a loss.

We go to the back of his car, he takes off my pants. And my penis is totally floppy. He toys with it. Nothing. After a while I help myself and and eventually get it up. Hmm. He‚Äôs going down on me. I close my eyes pretending it‚Äôs a hot chick. His braces don‚Äôt help. This isn‚Äôt working i thought.

I had a brainwave, I get out my phone open up pornhub and look up some mia Khalifa scenes. So here I am getting sucked off pretending it‚Äôs Mia khalifa. I got my headphones in and screen in front of my eyes with those big fake titties bouncing up and down. Whatcha doing, ‚Äúoh just listening to some music and texting my mom‚Äù that was weird why the fuck did I say that. Anyway.  He‚Äôs going down on me for like 15 mins. You can really last a long time he says. 

I close my eyes imagining that, that beautiful Arab was really around my penis. Rather than some random buff white dude.

 ‚ÄúMia‚Äù I moan and cum in his mouth.

You can go down on me now if you want?

If you come into the lecture hall 5-10 minutes before it ends to sit down for your next class, you're a fucking shitty person

In lecture, somebody decides to walk into our room at Center. Person walks around up and down on one side, looks around, then walks in FRONT of the professor (she just kept going with lecture) and goes up the other side to sit down.

Like what the fuck, are you that desperate to get a seat for the next class (which is a stem class, probably cs) that you're willing to interrupt a lecture?

It was bad enough when people kept peeking and opening our door every 10-15 minutes to see if they could sit down (they still go inside the hall and peek when our door is open). Like damn, its the end of week 3, you should know that there is class before yours (MWF), you shouldn't keep coming in and expecting an empty room, nor should you keep looking in after seeing a class is in session. Just wait for the class to be over when it's SUPPOSED to be over, not 5 not 10 minutes before.

It's been on the back-burner for a while that I've been getting too attached, that other people's perceptions of us were going to come into play, but it's been nice having another person so I haven't bothered to confront it. We spent the day with one of my long-time friends and she was so uncomfortable with us that she stayed quiet the whole time and told me later that it was ""too much"" and she'd never felt more like a third wheel despite the fact that we're not an item. I decided I needed to take a step back, dial everything down a notch because I know I'm getting too attached (they're leaving after the summer, I'm not) on top of the fact that something finally gave and we're now making others uncomfortable. We talked, and I told them I needed to step back. They told me that they've known this conversation was coming for a while and felt... resigned to it. I don't know where they are mentally on this. I can't tell, and they're trying to keep it masked which makes it even harder.

My emotions here are weird, and I don't know why I feel like I've lost them already. I've probably fucked up a relationship that was amazingly comforting to have, and something hurts deep. I don't know if my feelings here bridge past platonic or if I'm just terrible at losing people, despite the fact we're still going to be friends. I don't know how badly this is affecting them, and it's not leaving my mind, no matter how much I distract myself. I lied and told them some half-truth about why I was stepping back, but the majority of the reason is I don't know how attached I'm getting. I can't find the lines between platonic and romantic and any other kind of love you want to list, and I don't know if it's because they've been indulging my desire for physical affection or because of something actual, something concrete. I can't let this drag the both of us down, can't let myself depend on them too hard and make myself incapable of function on my own, can't burden them with my strange crises and muddled feelings. I don't want to destroy whatever remains of our friendship to an uncomfortable nothing by saying that I might have feelings, especially if when I find the lines it turns out I was safely within normal zones. There's some guilt about the lie, but they're masking things from me right now, too, and it's only adding to the mess that's settling between us. 

I don't know what I'm going to do. If I should try and clean up whatever I've mussed by telling them the truth about why I'm stepping back. If I should just try and ride out whatever's left here. I keep wanting to text them and take the entire conversation back, but the reasons are too pressing to ignore.

The doctor said I was medically fine but a social worker and psychiatrist needed to clear me so I had to wait.

8739,2019-01-18 11:33:51,"Hi, op of 3105 and 5690 here with some tips for my yeasty coochie pals. 

As you have probably guessed, I am quite prone/sensitive to yeast infections and I have successfuly kept them at bay, which makes my life much better, and I know others probably struggle with it too (or the opposite issue, BV).

Firstly, if you do have penetrative sex, for the sake of your yeasty friends not overpopulating your cupcake, lube up! A LOT. There cannot be too much lube! Also try not to have penetrative sex too frequently (but if you do, lube the heck up!)

Next, you know how a lot of us with boobies will take off our bra first thing we come home? I started doing that with my undies as well! (And I sleep with no undies now as well too) Invest in lots of long skirts/dresses so you can let your hoo-ha breathe, even when you're out and about! 
(With the exception of when/if you menstruate unless you use tampons/cups then yay! You can let your flippy lips out all month long!)

Personally I don't have much of a sweet tooth, but if you do, try to limit it or supplement with plain yogurt (yes, plain plain, none of that sweet yogurt). It's healthy and helps cultivate some healthy bacteria pals for your yeasties. You can also take probiotic pills but I think just eating better is a healthier option.

These simple things have kept the bakery at bay (especially the not wearing undies as much as possible). I hope this is helpful to someone who is looking to improve their coochie's health! This stuff happens and shouldn't be embarassing to talk about. ‚ù§

You gave us a second chance and I threw it away.

I should have just gotten up and been more aware. I want to blame it on me being tired, but I know that's no excuse. I listened to your request but just shrugged it off because I thought you were overreacting. I saw you getting frustrated, and I ignored it thinking you'd get over it. I didn't value your feelings in that moment as much as I should have. Little did I know that would be the last time we would be together, with you being gone before I noticed.

If I had the option to change one thing in my life, the chance to alter any of my selfish actions, I would redo that night in a heartbeat. I'm not fooling myself into thinking that this was solely the result of this one night, but I can't help but imagine that this outcome would have been different if I had acted as you expected me to. I wish that I'd have the opportunity to have one more chance, but I'll just have to live with the regret of you being the one that got away. You expected more from me, and I couldn't even provide that.

*tl;dr/incel content about romantic fantasy to an animated character*

This subject matter seems to be a bit meme-me but I will explained why it's not in the later part of the confession ( and why would I spend so much time writing a whole analytical confession and not submit it in turnitin) . I need to get this thought out of my mind or else it will fester in a weird, anti-social, incel obsession....

So I just watched Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse and I thought, as a self-proclaimed film buff, it is one of the best animated movie I have ever watched. I thought the movie does an excellent job in recreating NYC scenery, and each character was so well made, both in terms of animation and character development. So much well made that it mades me fall in love with Spider Gwen (Ghost Spider).  No, this is not the character fandom love that I am referring to. I mean a somewhat sexual but to a greater extent platonic love like with a real-life human. After I watched the movie I have this childish desire to make mine own particle accelerator like one in the movie and travel in Gwen's universe so I could be with Gwen and makes her mine. No, I don't want to date real life cosplay doppelg√§nger of Spider Gwen. I want to be physically live in the animated Earth-65 universe with animated Spider Gwen. Ironically, I am realistic and pragmatic human being in the real world who never have such weird fantasy in any aspects in my life.  Plus, I never like hentai because of its sickened view of love, i.e love without reciprocation, consent, responsibility and effort. I have been having this fantasy since after the day I watched the movie and felt terrible for having it. I felt futile since my love for Gwen is as real as it gets for a fictional animated characters that made with deterministic human personalities (i.e personalities that in fact are not the consequence of free will but are determined by the producers and the voice actor) and physical look right in the sweet spot of uncanny valley. In other words, it is absurd to have a human love with an inhuman character just because it has seemingly perfect set of human qualities . Even if I even disregard this philosophical-emotional hybrid dilemma, my frustration still stems from the fact it is physically impossible to send at my consciousness into a digital world that would be the animated universe.   If you are a bit of a film buff yourself, my predicaments are similar with the plot of the movie Her but only thing that is different is these feelings are real. For now, I have been blocking any thoughts about Spiderman in general so that I can get rid of this fantasy and hope that by writing this eccentric piece of confession it will help speed up the process because I don't want to be the same person that I disdained to be.

I'm a little sad that are relationship ended (it wasn't meant to be for many reasons),  but I'm crushed that after doing so much for her, and truly caring about her happiness, she cuts me off. I opted for the safer route of ""never to have loved at all"" for most of my life instead of the far more risky ""loved and lost."" I don't know if I regret going for the latter now that the ""lost"" part generates so much pain and loneliness. God I could use a hug. Too bad the person I always turn to for comforting is the reason I need it.
Most of my pain comes from the ex, but I feel so betrayed by our ""friend."" I chose to trust and see the best in her. I turned to her for relationship advice, looked to her as a voice of reason, and confided in her about my ex and I's relationship issues all while she promised me I could trust her.

I‚Äôm a current second year who‚Äôs had no intention of going to grad school. I found out this week that my mom wants me to go to grad school. (And to stop all the people who say I shouldn‚Äôt feel pressured by my parents, in high school I was taking college classes along with high school and my mom only wanted me to take one class while my dad wanted me to take two. My mom never spoke up about it so I took two. If she would have said anything I would have dropped one class in a heart beat. If my dad said he wanted me to go to grad school (which I‚Äôm sure he would) I would laugh in his face and say no). All I really aspire to be is a mother of 5+ dogs in a simple, comfortable house. I know in my heart I can find the brute strength to power through grad school (and be the first one in my extended family to get a PhD). I‚Äôd also have enough time that I wouldn‚Äôt be playing catch up to get on the same level as everyone else who wants to go to grad school (RIP pre meds). But going to grad school is a lot of work and motivation that I don‚Äôt really want to deal with. I‚Äôm also not really sure who I can talk to in order to completely work out my feelings about it and make up my decision. Like, is it even worth it to go to grad school as an engineering major?!

So before we were dating, there was this girl who he had a crush on. At first, she didn't have any ""interests"" in my bf. When my bf and I became official, she started to say all kinds of flirty stuff with my bf and even when I said hi to her, she would just straight up ignore me. Also, she even said bad things about me to my bf...
Anyways, so I started to lose my shit since this girl is like vicious and super offensive and I did tell my bf to block her from our life and he did it since he really wanted to be with me. 
After all these years, I still go online and check her profile, and it is just so disturbing to me that she is such a ""nice and innocent girl"" on instagram. Like dude she is so evil in real life tho.....
I always think about this when I'm down and sometimes cry to sleep since I'm so insecure. I dont blame my bf since he is trying to make me feel secure and love me all he can. But how do I get this shit out of my head.....

8545,2019-01-05 18:22:41,"I've never been in a relationship before. The last time I almost did was during my first year of college.Being my first year, I was trying to go out, visit the beach and meet people, but more than anything I wanted to build friendships. One evening I found myself visiting one of the dining halls a little before closing. After picking up my food I contemplated going back to my building and just eating my dinner in my room at my desk. I probably wasn't thinking of it like this at the time, but I wasn't giving myself an opportunity to meet anyone if I continued to do that.

So I wandered the dining hall, just a bit. Looking for a familiar face (if there was any).  I did my best to not look lost or like I was trying to not be alone. I was pretty sure there wasn't anyone around, and just as I was about to leave the dining hall, I saw him. He was eating alone, no distractions in front of him. No phone, no headphones. I knew I'd seen him around before, probably in one of my classes or my building. So I walked over and greeted him, we introduced each other and I asked if I could join him for dinner. He accepted. 

We ended up talking a lot that evening, the dining hall had been cleaned and prepped for the next day by the time we were asked to leave. As we were leaving the dining hall I remember not wanting our conversation to end. We spent more time together that night, talking about I don't remember what. A little bit of everything I suppose.

We ended up making plans to go on runs together, grab lunch and dinner together. He even introduced me to some of his favorite shows. I didn't particularly enjoy them for the most part, but spending time with him was fun.
We'd go on runs together, visit museums, go to the beach, do homework in the common rooms. If we weren't in class we were hanging out.

I remember one night when most of his suite-mates were gone, either a holiday weekend or some break like that, we were watching a movie in his room. We were lying on his bed and at some point we just started pushing against each other playfully. This playfulness escalated to the point where I had him pinned underneath me. I never wrestled and I don't normally behave like this.

I lowered my waist to meet his, and as soon as I made contact I put a little more of my weight on him. It didn't take long for us to start rubbing against each other. It was a physical sensation I had not previously experienced.

He was my first lover, my first kiss, my first sleeping with someone. I remember making my way to and from his room those few days in my pj's carrying my pillow and bringing snacks so we could cuddle, ""play"", and watch tv together.

If this was all so great, what are you confessing?

As great as it all was, I wasn't ready for a relationship, heck I'm not even sure if I know what dating means anymore and if I'll ever get around to dating.

I wasn't relationship ready in general. I had no sense of independence and having just started school I was afraid it was too early to start getting into anything like that. 

But more than anything else, I didn't know how to be with someone of the same gender. As much fun as I had, and yes I liked him, there was too much for me to figure out. I never questioned or really thought about my sexual orientation. I didn't grow up particularly religious either. For not having any strong convictions for or against such relationships I was very hesitant to go any further. I never got around to seeing or experimenting with anyone before college.

It's been a few years since then. I distanced myself from him because I didn't want to be thought of anything that I maybe wasn't (if that makes sense?). 

As with some things, hindsight offers me the opportunity to look back and realize that I missed an opportunity to try something new and with someone that was genuinely interested in seeing me grow and grow with me ;)

Having shared all this, I just want to remind myself, and anyone having read this far, that second chances don't come often, and sometimes we fail to recognize opportunities for growth and self-discovery the first time around.

I am a lurker in the bio group chat, and the way that most of the people bullied, or talked to, one of the members really made me sick to my stomach. So apparently this one member was always made fun of and trolled because she said that she just wanted to transfer out of UCSD to UCLA, and she was made fun of for wanting to take premed courses over the summer to get ahead and needing tutor help for a ""easy"" class such as Chem 6A. 
At first, it was just simply trolling her in the group chat by giving random answers to her questions, but then it got to a point where she was outright being bullied and insulted by everyone.
 It is genuinely not right to do this, and I was so extremely shocked to see this happen at such a uni such as UCSD. So what that someone wants to transfer out of UCSD to UCLA? so what if she feels that she needs a tutor for a ""easy"" class such as Chem 6A? 
None of you guys have the right to make fun of someone and bully them for that. Maybe it is parental pressure, maybe she was brought up with those values, who knows? And why should she be made fun of for wanting a tutor for chem 6A? It was right of her to try to seek out help if she feels that she is struggling, because some people really do need that extra help and push at the beginning. This is especially after months of celebrities committing suicide such as Kate Spade and Anthony Bourdain in the news, and the general consensus that self-esteem and mental wellness is a big issue in our generation, so as aspiring physicians (most of you) I hope you all would take that into account. If she wants to spend the extra money on private tutoring or whatever, so be it, stop saying thats bougie or that you dont have the ""resources"" because you are out-of-state or that your broke while going on a boba run every single day and eating out every other meal. Everyone one has some issues: some people are broke, some people have parental issues, some people have mental issues: there is really no need to be unnecessarily rude, because you really don't know WHAT IS GOING ON IN OTHER PEOPLE'S LIVES!
What I am trying to say is, you all need to respect other people's questions and decisions. Just because you are a STEM ""premed"" major does not put you on a pedestal: what do you really hope to accomplish by being mean?

8497,2019-01-04 02:54:31,"To the people in #8434 who say things like ""why bother if the date was bad?"" The reason why you still have to tell them is because even if you think it went bad, they might not. Telling them will give them 1. closure and 2. a reason to better themselves for their next date. Bonus points for letting them know what went wrong. It's really just basic human decency and not doing so is extremely inconsiderate.

Some examples of what ghosting feels like for the pro ghosters who may not understand the ramifications of their actions:

1.Eating a bowl of premium high quality pasta, but having it taken away before you finish even though you're still really hungry. 
2. Reading a mystery novel but they never reveal who did it.
3. Hearing an amazing song, probably your new favorite, but never being told the title and being unable to find it ever again.

Rape fantasies are very, very common among women, especially in the US. Anywhere from 1 in 3 to 2 in 3 women admit to having rape fantasies, so chances are the new friends you get will also have similar fantasies.

Why? Well because of messy gender dynamics of course. Women are not supposed to seek out sex, but of course women also enjoy sex. So rape fantasies are a marriage between the two: a woman indulges in sex, but only against her will thus no guilt is involved. Rape also has themes of being dominated and so forth, which hits fairly common kinks.

Now that we said all that, keep in mind this is all just fantasy. This is your head exploring sexuality, so in the end you're still in control. This is why fantasies are sexy but real rape is not. I'd also advise you to tell your friends to be careful sharing their fantasies with their sex partners unless they trust them, because people get really weird about them.

8478,2019-01-03 00:37:50,"Three years ago on NYE I left the part I was at to go to my favorite spot in town that overlooked the bay, where I can see all the lights at night, and I bawled my eyes out because I never thought that I would make it past 18, let alone be in college. I've had major depression for the last 9 years. I have scars on my wrists and legs and arms, I've tried to kill myself a few times and have on a daily basis considered stepping out into the middle of traffic. I never thought I would make it this far. I never thought I wanted to make it this far. I have goals and ambition but random triggers pull me back all the time to my past experiences and it unravels all the progress I've made. On NYE the memory of me standing on that hill crying with pain and happiness flooded back to me. I thought about all that I have done since then and how much stronger I've gotten. I've come to terms with the realization that I can glue the pieces of me back together but I will never be perfect again, my cracks will always show. 

So, today may seem like a small day to you but to others just being here is a huge accomplishment. 

To those suffering from the hands of their past abuse I want to share something that I realized a little while back that is usually phrased for relationships: Every 7 years your body replaces all of its cells ( I know this is not entirely true, but it works for this), where in the future you can be assured that one day an ex you once loved will never have touched your new skin. But after hearing that statement a few times I realized that in the next few years I will have skin that was never touched by my abuser. So if you are struggling, know that one day, even though the memories are still there, you will one day have skin that was never hurt.

Good Luck in the new year and please remember that things can change for the better and that time can heal.",,trigger warning,,Thu,12.0,8.0,104.54400000000017,66.0,97.81199999999997,0.113,0.787,0.099,-0.7643,00

She brought a lot of positive energy to the people around her. I loved how she smiled to and encouraged everyone to be better, how she literally glowed every time she talked about her research. 
For two and a half months, I tried my best to stand out in the class. I tried to finish everything before going to the sessions so that I could talk to her more, and ask her extra questions. Later in the quarter, when there were more people coming to the see her because the class had become increasingly harder. I would study a little extra to understand the materials because I could help the other students so that she‚Äôd have more time for me. We hanged out once at the end of the quarter but I thought she still considered me as one of her students.
I know it sounds like it‚Äôs a temporary infatuation and it‚Äôs gonna go away,  or maybe I like her because she‚Äôs in a position that has power over me or because she‚Äôs mature etc (heck, I‚Äôm even older than her because I took a couple years off). 
But I have really fallen for her and as an undergrad I know that I would have no chance with her. The sad part is I am ok with it. I have accepted that she is better off without me.

And then she goes on this rant about how she's a doctor and she was able to get all of this because she could afford it, and how I'll never be able to do that with arts. I'm sorry, I don't really care about being rich. And her life would just be fucking miserable for me.

Doesn't help that I'm gay, and Indian people are stupidly homophobic. And the fact that I have a Korean boyfriend makes it worse. Indians are also hella racist. I'm sick of it all. I just want my parents to disown me so I don't have to put up with any of it. Or at the very least, they don't require me to meet anyone when I come home, and they stop talking about me.

I resent my family, my ""friends"", and the Indian Community as a whole. Im a whole lot happier now that I'm far away from all of them.

Maybe this is my insecurity talking but now that we live together I feel like you don't care. I know it's probably ridiculous to want you to text me good morning every morning we don't wake up togethere and you wake up first. I just need to know you're thinking about me.

8370,2018-12-26 12:28:09," TL;DR: I went on Tinder to get sex but got body dysmorphia instead. 
Tinder has successfully destroyed my self esteem and has made me utterly disgusted by my own self image. I have tried multiple different sets of photos all to no avail.  Over the course of a year I have done extensive work to improve my looks: incorporating exercise 6-7 days a week in my schedule (1-3 hours per session), I've have spent THOUSANDS of dollars on new clothing to enhance my style, I have tried (and am still trying) multiple different hairstyles  to find the one that best suits me, and a result of all this I have gotten a whopping NOTHING on Tinder. The only thing I haven't tried is plastic surgery, which I would be 110% down for if I knew that it would be almost guaranteed that I would benefit from it. 

But do you know what really fucking irks me? It's not the fact that in that year of feeble attempts to improve the way I look I didn't get anywhere remotely near a vagina, but the fact that I spent countless hours obsessing over my looks, starring into a fucking mirror wondering what to do to make myself more appealing to the opposite sex, comparing photos of myself to other guys to see what they have that I don't. I could have used that time to study more (which I desperately needed cuz UCSD) or become proficient at an instrument... 

I am understand that I am not entitled to intimacy or sex, but IT STILL FUCKING HURTS that I am not getting any. Go ahead, insult me, call me an incel, creep, ugly, entitled, WHATEVER YOU WANT, I don't need your fucking pity. Also, don't recommend me to go to CAPS or a therapist, I have been seeing a fucking shrink(s) for a while now. ""Maybe try working on your social skills so you don't rely on a superficial app like Tinder?"" Trust me, I have been fucking doing that too.

I just want girls to find me physically attractive...I guess it is time to move on with life...Who the fuck am I kidding I am probably just gonna continue to obsess over how I look, try a new look and another set of photos, rebuild my confidence, and TEAR IT ALL THE FUCK DOWN AGAIN WHEN I DON'T GET ANY PUSSY AGAIN.

He said he's ""always gonna be there for me"" and to let him know if he could do anything to help. I told him i needed to distract myself, to call someone, that i needed his presence. However, he said his family doesn't want him on his phone and that's why he can't call. We haven't skyped for about a month, and i didn't receive a call on christmas. He even got upset at me when he said ""what do you need babe?"" ""I need someone who is actually gonna support me through this tough time and be there for me"" ""so i don't do that?"" But throughout all this he seemed not caring at all even though I told him explicitly how to help me. He seems to ask how i'm feeling and what he can do to help only for commitment, because when I tell him I feel really sad he says ""oh ok babe i hope you feel better"". I understand he is with his family on christmas eve, but i wish he would've made the effort to tell them ""i need to go out for 5 minutes to call my girlfriend, she is grieving and I wan't to see if she's ok"".

Maybe it's just my own understanding of sex being quite different from most others (I think of it as a way of having fun and it's a separate thing from romantic attraction). But the key to having a stable fwb kind of thing is to clearly understand your boundaries and making sure both of you are happy with what you want and what you're getting. If you just wanna hookup but your partner wants a romantic relationship that's a no-go.

That doesn't mean you shouldn't talk about this kind of thing with your fwb, don't get me wrong, I am close friends with mine and I've talked about things with her that I normally don't with anyone else. Communication is super important!

If I do take adderall multiple times a week I get, at the least, passing grades. I take anywhere between 60-120 milligrams of adderall in one dose, at least 4 times a week. There have been nights where I stared up at my ceiling while lying in bed, my heart pounding dangerously close to 200bpm and my eyes open as wide as possible, where I was convinced I was going to die of a heart attack within the next few hours. Absolutely convinced and waiting for death. I've always dismissed my adderall usage as necessary to be a functioning member of society, but when I'm on adderall I become a reclusive, borderline psychotic person, clenching my teeth so hard that their alignment becomes disfigured and don't fit together properly anymore so I can't even bite down at all anymore. When I work on adderall, my work is not about getting the work done, it is about writing with the perfect handwriting. If I write any character that doesn't look exactly how I want it, I erase and rewrite till it looks perfect. When I work on adderall, my work is not about getting the work done, it is about doing the problems that I actually understand over and over again just to make myself feel good about the fact that I understand a problem and like the way it looks when I solve it on paper. Not to mention that every time I take adderall it is not to get work done, it is simply to feel that jolt of motivational energy that makes it feel like anything that I do is productive and worthwhile. This means sometimes I take adderall and play single-player video games secluded in my room for 8-9 hours at a time. (I beat Red Dead Redemption 2 in five days, all side quests, legendary animals, and main story missions complete). I don't see an end to my adderall usage anywhere in the near future. My life revolves around adderall, I've stolen money from my parents to get adderall, I've lost friends due to adderall, my sober mind is always thinking about the next time I can take adderall. My lies about my life and usage are what caused my girlfriend of three years to break up with me. When I'm sober, I miss her so much that it physically hurts. So I take adderall just to be able to get my mind on other things. By other things I mean get my mind to obsess over one singular thing for 8-10 hours of the day before I inevitably crash and feel the need to either take more adderall, or ""sleep."" Moral of the story I guess, be very careful with adderall cause it can get its clenches on you and never let go.",[redacted],"serious, addiction",,Mon,17.0,22.0,26.134000000000093,161.63700000000003,108.83200000000016,0.099,0.811,0.09,-0.5283,05
8327,2018-12-23 22:57:39,"Tldr; my boyfriend and I have different religious beliefs, send help. Muslim advice needed for confused outsider .-.


The other day, my boyfriend and I were talking about bringing our relationship out to the public, which is something he‚Äôd be terrified to do because he is Muslim. I was born into a catholic family, practiced christianity for a bit, and am not ashamed to admit that right now I‚Äôm confused and still wondering what religion I believe in the most.  For a bit of context (and I don‚Äôt pretend to know everything about this which is why I‚Äôm seeking advice) the ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù (?) way to find your wife would be for your family to set you up with someone under the same religion, you court them, and then you marry. No room for ‚Äòdating‚Äô an outsider like me. (With the exception of MAYBE if I was very Christian? People of scripture? Apparently there are exceptions type of thing, someone please clarify) Well see WHOOPS, we fell in love. WHOOPS. 

Well now when we for real get deep and talk about us in the context of religion, etc, he says he is torn between two ideas. 1) Knowing that this feels right and that in the end, whether it be marriage or whatever it may be, that it will turn out ok. Things would work out, maybe I‚Äôd even become muslim, or not, (because right now I really don‚Äôt know what I am) but that in the afterlife there wouldn‚Äôt be punishment for loving someone like this. OR 2) This ‚Äúfeels right‚Äù because it‚Äôs a distraction from Shaytan, or in other words Satan, who is making him feel as though something this wrong can actually be okay. And it‚Äôs something he‚Äôs supposed to recognize as a trick or deception? 

I‚Äôm understanding, but it honestly hurts to be in love with someone who for a lack of a better word, is so unsure. I told him that if I went to confession, I don‚Äôt think a pastor would tell me I‚Äôm wrong for being in love with him. Or that I should break it off. And I asked if there was anyone that he could talk to ‚Ä¶ And he said that he knows they would tell him that it‚Äôs improper and to break it off and that he knows that, just doesn‚Äôt want to hear it. I get so hurt thinking someone could believe in something that could teach that love like this is so wrong‚Ä¶ but then again to him, Allah is a metaphysical thing that is above everything we know and feel and so it makes sense that his message is universal and above what we may be feeling. 

This rarely gets in the way, we don‚Äôt fight, we even talk about religion occasionally, and it‚Äôs never a negative experience. It‚Äôs just the residual feeling of sadness I get thinking he‚Äôs scared of this. 

I guess my question is more for the Muslim community. Give me perspective. Give me advice. Am I supposed to want to push him away for his own beliefs? Or what am I supposed to think. Have you as a Muslim ever accidentally fallen in love with someone outside of the Islamic belief system? What is he or I supposed to do according to your beliefs? And Christians, what about you? 


To anyone who may think: ‚ÄúIf he loves you, he‚Äôd change,‚Äù no. Please don‚Äôt even comment. I‚Äôve come to learn and respect his ideas wholeheartedly. Love or any human feeling does not trump the word of Allah to my man and though it‚Äôs not something I fully understand, I stand by him and support his decision to believe that.

I was eventually shortlisted and flew over to the University of Oxford at short notice in December for a week for admissions interviews. I had a fairly splendid time there, but I honestly do not know how I did: I met some awesome people there, got free room and board, and was able to eat for free for a week in THE Harry Potter dining hall and at the staircase and took some bomb ass photos as well. I really enjoyed my time there, getting to sleep in a 500 year old dorm just above a world famous picture gallery right next to one of the oldest cathedrals in the world. 
My point is, I am so nervous, so anxious, so hellbent on the admissions decision that would come out on the night of January 8th, 2019. I know that I should not be defined by a college decision, but whether or not I get accepted will obviously change so many things for me and my family.
If I am not accepted, I will take it as having had a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to experience Oxford, both as a vacation and as an educational experience.
However, if I am accepted, I will have the option to withdraw from UCSD immediately and spend time saving up money until the next academic school year. I will be classmates with extremely intellectually stimulating classmates, and even some whom are members of British aristocracy. (during my short time there I have already met someone whose dad was one of the most famous comedians and writers of the 20th century). If I do get in, I feel like my parents work will all have paid off since they have invested over $1500 dollars into this application process, mainly the transportation. 
Since I was invited for an interview (not everyone is), I feel so close yet so far from making it, and I am trying my best to take my mind off of it during winter break and trying to enjoy the holidays, but it is really difficult :(

current day: i fucking hate this weather i hate everything im low key depressed i cant think straight and pretending everything is ok even though everything isnt and its really taking a toll on me, i have no one to emotionally rant to anymore because its not who I am to pretend im suffering so I keep it all inside me and I don't know what to do besides rant on confessions sometimes because its all thats keeping me from going insane, im impulsively buying because I realize its the only thing I can do to prevent me to indulging in any other harmful substances because i'm hopeless and lost. i feel the urge to pretend to flex and talk about raving because I feel like those are some of the few topics I can bring up before I get in a talk about anything else before I feel like I get depressed and because of some ptsd insecurities Ive had in the past because of not having ""good clothing"" so ur considered a waste of space at ur hs and because its a tiny ass school theres not a lot of mobility for friend groups. a lot of my friends are fake and i got fucking snaked recently because I let my guard down thinking people are all cheery and great when in reality if they want something from you they'll fucking give up up for nothing and spread shit you thought you told them to keep low key. i know my life itself isnt that bad and I shouldn't have the privilege to complain, I got a family that supports me well with money, I got a bunch of friends I could talk to but I just feel like theres no one I can really connect to in order to rant so I guess ill just rant here and hope someone i know recognizes this is me.

#1 Community Dining Plan
If you still eat Dining Hall Food (bless up for Roots, OVT, The Bistro, and the soups served around campus on a cold rainy afternoon), DON'T USE YOUR DEBIT CARD and instead put some money in the community dining plan. You only need to put in a minimum of $25 and with every purchase, you get 20% off. You'll find that HDH food is actually quite affordable this way. I also love getting the fruit tarts at some of the markets. Also good when you're sick of Price Center food when you're studying at Geisel!

#2 OASIS
There's so many confessions on here talking about being afraid of failing class. Take the initiative to sign up for classes at OASIS. It's been around for like 40 years and the workshop facilitators have trained for a quarter in the subject they teach and also how to teach. Sign up at oasis.ucsd.edu. Go to Services >> Math/Science Tutorial Program. They teach all of the lower division math (MATH10ABC, MATH20ABC, Math 11, Math 18), lower division chem (Gen Chem and OChem) and Physics 1 and 2 series. You can also request one-on-one tutoring for other subjects like PSYC 60. 

#3 CLEAN YA INBOX UP
I don't know about yours but my department sends me lots of information about internships, scholarships, and other opportunities that I feel students miss all the time because they have 1000+ unread emails in your inbox. Send spam to your personal, but keep your school inbox tight! This might also be why lots of y'all miss your finals because loads of professors will email you about room changes or remind you to turn shit in...

That's all I can think of for now (while also keeping some life hacks to myself to preserve resources..) but hopefully y'all are smarter about using the resources already given to us on campus. Yes, we may not be given everything we need to fully function, but there ARE resources. It is up to YOU to be resourceful!",,lifehacks,,Sat,10.0,10.0,64.2509999999999,58.079999999999856,62.435999999999844,0.055,0.874,0.07,0.743,23

I have been in and out of therapy for the past few years and ever since my first suicide attempt, which occurred on campus, my grades kept getting worse until I was eventually academically disqualified.  I took some time off and eventually took courses at a CC for a year and I was able to reapply to UCSD and be readmitted. This has been my first quarter back at UCSD after almost 2 years and the fucking hoops I have had to jump AFTER being readmitted have been ridiculous. First, the readmission process took FOREVER and by the time they readmitted me, all the classes had been filled and I had to take almost all electives because those were the only classes with open spots. Secondly, the financial aid office put me on probation and said I would have to pay my fees out of pocket each quarter until they could review my grades and decide if they will give me my loans for each quarter. Before I even started my Fall quarter, I had to borrow almost 5k from my boyfriend so I wouldn't be dropped from all of my classes and I will have to continue doing this before each quarter starts or else I will be dropped from everything and have to waitlist. Mind you, I am now a senior so I can't afford to be dropped from classes and get on a long ass waitlist for all of my classes. Thirdly, my major counselor fucked me over and told me to sign up for a class that I did not meet the prerequisites for so when I tried to sign up for this class, I couldn't. I told her about it and she said I will need to sign up for a 199 instead since I couldn't sign up for this research course on WebReg. How the fuck am I supposed to find a professor that will take a 199 student with an almost nonexistent GPA? And 2 quarters of this is required for my major. Fourthly, my grades came out for this quarter and even though my quarter GPA should have me in good standing, I just got a message telling me that I am subject to disqualification again because my cumulative GPA is still shit but even if I had received a 4.0 for this quarter, my cumulative GPA would have still been below a 2.0 so I don't how they expected me to pull my cumulative GPA up so much after just one quarter back??? I just feel like they are going to kick me out again even though I am trying to pass all my classes, keep my job so I can afford my rent, and do all of this while managing my mental illness pretty much on my own because my Kaiser therapist can only see me once every other month.

8237,2018-12-19 02:40:04,"Tldr boyfriend from 7447;

Two days ago, I asked OP for another chance - I told her I made a mistake and I want to do right by her, by me and by us. She (after a lot of pleading) finally agreed to give me one last shot and this post today is meant to be something to help me clear my conscience before a new beginning, as well as my plea to all other people in a relationship to not make the same mistakes I did.  Ever since that night that I first saw you in class, my life hasn‚Äôt been the same my love. I enjoyed our journey as much as you did. But I also know it hasn‚Äôt been easy for you. You told people the smiles and rainbows of us. It‚Äôs only fitting I bear the blame for our darkest moments before I can proceed on a fresh start with you.

I remember looking at u for the first time in our class of 24 people and just thinking to myself, those are the prettiest eyes and smile I have ever seen. I remember you in your olive jeans and denim jacket and being mesmerized with you from that first class. I remember coming over to your place to do homework and asking you out that same night. I told you that I didnt wanna be without you one moment because I didnt want to risk loosing you to some other guy who may ask you out. That was the beginning of our adventure which you proceeded to tell people about in 7447. Thank you baby for saving me the effort of typing so much out. My confession is going to be relatively shorter.

I have hurt you a lot. I know. This isn‚Äôt the first time I‚Äôve screwed up - I know. Over the course of one year, I have been battling a lot with my own paranoia and what it means to live life and I have projected that onto our relationship many times causing you so much pain. My insecurities about us, about myself, would take many forms - sometimes I would think dedicating time to you would snatch away from my classes and perhaps I should end it so I could focus on myself more. Sometimes I would think - I‚Äôll eventually go off to grad school and we‚Äôre statistically going to break up then; maybe I should save us the heartbreak and just end this now. I kissed another girl when in a wrong frame of mind. And this last time - I convinced myself that no matter how good our story is there are just parts of us that are incompatible. 

I believe that a lot of other people out there face such decisions as I well. They can‚Äôt decide whether the choices they make are right or wrong and are often just befuddled by my relationship. Baby I‚Äôve never been under so much distress under any of my relationships and I honestly feel that my paranoia comes from the fact that your really the first girlfriend whose stood out to me as someone I may wanna spend my life with. As a result, my brain tries to find all the reasons to not let go and surrender myself to you. I keep coming up with excuses and reasons why we shouldn‚Äôt be together (as listed in the past paragraph), when the only real think I had to consider was whether I wanted to be with u and whether or not you made me happy. I tried to find the 100s of reasons why we can‚Äôt work when all I needed to look for was the one reason we can. And that reason is simple - you send butterflies through my stomach everytime you throw me a sincere smile, or sashy with attitude, or even when ur just lying on my chest at 7am before we start the day and go to our classes.

Baby this relationship has caused us both to go through tough times and I‚Äôm blessed that I got to go through these things with someone as strong as you. You‚Äôve helped me through one of the most uncertain periods of my life. I‚Äôm not gonna lie - I dont deserve you baby - I really don‚Äôt. You were there for me high and low and now I want the chance to be there for you as well. You‚Äôve helped me when I wasn‚Äôt sure of what it even meant to love. You were with me when I kissed someone else when half drunk - sure u were as angry as hulk and ik the incident hurt u way more than you let on in front of me - but I‚Äôm fortunate that you didn‚Äôt leave me in that treacherous time.

A lot of this is really personal to me and the only reason I‚Äôm posting it on a page like this is because I want to encourage people to learn from the mistakes I‚Äôve made and from the things my baby did right. Through this past year I‚Äôve learned that to be in love with someone is more than the moments you share with them, the songs you both jam to, the hours you spend studying before a final, the crazy adventures you take with one another. To love someone is to believe in someone else. To love is to forgive and persevere. I‚Äôm not saying that everyone should be forgiven for whatever wrong doings they do in a relationship. But I am saying that it‚Äôs unfair to keep posing hypothetical questions about why things will fail, instead of posing the hypothetical question what if things work. I made that mistake and my girlfriend was strong enough to stick by me through each high and low - and for that I am grateful. I wish I could be more like you baby. 

Try to trust people with your heart. 

P.S. my love if you read this, you recently asked me why you should give me another chance. And baby, all I have to say is that I want another chance to do right by you. And just like Naruto never gave up on his dream to be Hokage, or just like Amy Farrah Fowler didn‚Äôt give up on Sheldon Cooper despite his quirky personality, I‚Äôm not ready to give up on who we may become just yet. I can‚Äôt force you to take me back. And I can‚Äôt promise that the road from here-on-out is gonna be flowers and roses. But baby it‚Äôs taken me some time to understand you‚Äôre the only one I wanna go down this road with. Because you‚Äôre the one I believe in now.

Anyways, she needed to get a pill, but I'm in another country now, and in this country I guess it's very difficult and expensive to get a pill. I actually learned something useful from this, that we should increase access to birth control, I'm not tryna be a daddy at 23 while I'm in school and don't have a job, and she's not tryna have a kid either.

@#8092: i‚Äôm a fourth year and i‚Äôve struggled for years trying to focus on studying for subjects and have trouble prioritizing tasks i need and want to do first. Do I doodle on my iPad? Or work on this function for my CS program? Oh wait, I could cook, study some mol bio, and at least two-three times while thinking of what else I would include in this sentence I forgot what I was thinking about (rip). 
I failed several CS classes because doing the long assignments was overwhelming and I would put things off to the last minute. Homework turned in for my non CS classes was usually incomplete. Just this year alone I lost my Apple Pencil, my watch for a month, three pairs of earbuds, a power bank, a jacket and (almost) lost my wallet at a con this year because some people are good Samaritans. 
‚Äî‚Äî
I was diagnosed with ADHD earlier this year and i‚Äôve been taking medication along with wanting to start therapy next year to help. It‚Äôs been immensely helpful in keeping me on just one task instead of eight but I know that I have to be careful using it.  
It saddens me hearing people taking adderall for tests when they don‚Äôt need it. Some college students with, you know, actual disorders need medication to function with a vestige of normality. Some don‚Äôt need and just require therapy, but the stigma for having meds is harder because people abuse it. 
‚Äî‚Äî
I say this because I have a 2.7 gpa and a shit transcript because of the classes I failed. I probably can‚Äôt get into grad school for a while even though I really want to do research and become a professor. I was too late in trying to fix my problems and I think I could be in a much better spot if I acknowledged earlier that I had issues. 
I hope any of you who think about taking adderall or ADHD medication think twice if you weren‚Äôt prescribed it. If you are having legitimate problems and they were there before college, talk to CAPS! Treatment can help. I worry for those that face such stigma and were in a similar spot like I.

I‚Äôm a little mad and I started to ramble, so I apologize. This isn‚Äôt a pity story. I‚Äôm not happy with my gpa because I should have been more proactive.

Here's what I have to say to both parties:
To those who find it necessary to critque others bodies: what benefit do you gain from saying so? First of all, you're wrong to say that nobody likes fat girls since there definitely are people who do. You may be correct in saying that a majority of guys don't like fat girls but really is this the way youre going to go about it?

To my keyboard warriors and others who feel affected: They're not completely wrong. I know it sucks to hear it, and it might come off shitty, but people do have physical preferences, and for a majority of guys being bigger is not a plus. Granted, its not the only thing that matters, but it is very hard to want a relationship with someoen you have no physical desire for. The reason I feel the need to say this is not to make people feel bad, but to not allow them to have false notions of themselves. Nobody deserves to ask ""why don't people like me"" and not be able to get an answer. Some people truly don't care about how others perceive them, and to them thats actually amazing! But to those that do, well now you have it.

Thanks for giving your story and opinion about the topic. Im sorry that t happened to you, but im glad in the end you could find a compromise with it. For me, especially being in college and around people who drink pretty regularly the not letting my father dictate my actions on drinking has come up pretty often in my head. It's honestly a constant struggle because I go back and forth about the situation pretty frequently. I don't want him to control my actions on the matter because if he wasn't the way he was then I probably would drink just like any other college student. But I can't help but feel like a hypocrite. I grew up hating what he was and that alcohol was the thing that made him that way. That's properly the main reason why I don't want to drink (but also I just dont like the weird looks that people give me because I choose not to. Like let me live my life lol).

the one about the not wanting to drink because of your father. 
what I am saying is not trying to convince you to start drinking at all. But I never wanted to start drinking because my dad (who is now dead) was also an alcoholic who beat the shit out of my mom night after night in a studio apartment right in front of me and my sister who weren't even teenagers. 
I chose not to drink because I didn't want to be anything like my father. But my older cousin who also had an alcoholic dad told me (after he found i dont drink) that i shouldnt let a dead person who caused so much pain in my life and those I love to control any aspect of my life. He told me that my choice not to drink shouldn't have anything to do with my father. It should be my own decision. 
I still don't drink, except for the occasional beer on fridays after a long week, and two or three shots of soju on special occasions (since its rude to reject shots of soju from anyone older than you in korean culture haha)

I should take the blame and the full responsibility for the financial insecurity I feel like me and my family are going to be in after this year is out.
I really REALLY want to be optimistic about this and say I'll get a high-paying job that can pay the bills, but I have absolutely no confidence that I can.
I sometimes think that I am going to kill myself over this debt, but I know that would just devastate everyone even further. It worries me to think if these loans were not in my parents' names I probably would have acted on this at some point.

8100,2018-12-11 13:18:02,"So I matched with a cute tinder boy and we had a very nice chat on Tinder. After a while I gave him my snap. We‚Äôve been snapping back and forth until he (inevitably it seems like) asked me for nudes. Now I would likely have sex with this tinder boy as he is very cute and not an asshole (yet). I‚Äôm also okay with the idea of sending nudes, in theory. To me, like it‚Äôs very flattering that some random guy off the internet wants to jack off to pictures of my boobs (without my face) vs almost anything else on the Internet. I also like the idea that with Snapchat you (supposedly) send the picture to one person and it vanishes. The only thing is one of my ex‚Äôs kept my nudes without telling me. We were exchanging nudes, I‚Äôd prefer him to jack off to me instead of random porn stars especially if I was unable to see him for a week or more (like a trip). I would send pictures over Snapchat and after awhile he asked if he could keep some. I said yes and to screenshot them off of Snapchat so I know what he has. A few weeks later he showed me the calculator app where he had all my nudes and there were a lot more than what I had seen him screenshot. Turns out he had a special app that let you take screenshots of peoples snaps without letting them know. I felt kind of violated. Like my condition was simple, screenshot to let me know what you have. So basically I probably would have sent this tinder boy nudes but I don‚Äôt trust guys with nudes anymore. Now he‚Äôs left me on read for a few hours so I guess this is the end of our attempt at a relationship which is really a bummer because I was getting too attached.

It gives me a kaleidoscope of emotions, the songs all blend it to one piece of music, it has to be listened to in order to be understood.

Back home when i just started smoking weed when i was 16 me and my two best mates would all ways get supper stoned and then just lay their in  silence with head phones on listening to it full blast. One top tip is to stay up really late till about 4am and you must have got up early that day. Then at 4am smoke more weed than you have ever done before literally push your limits, take like 10 dabs, then listen to this with headphones in or a loud speaker and every time you feel yourself about to sleep you turn the volume up.

I hope you can reply anonymously here with your examples, don‚Äôt leave us high and dry OR yknow literally any member can sit in on any and all board meetings, so if you really think somm‚Äô sketch is happening behind the scenes, go sit in, give your input, tell them what‚Äôs on your mind and how you think the org can be better. 

You ask ‚Äúwhat this org is even about now?‚Äù
There are plenty of people who honestly don‚Äôt even know what KP nor what KAA is, but join just to be put in a family and once they get picked up, never show up to any events or even stay in contact with their fam. Also people join cos they hear it‚Äôs a party org, but leave when they find out there‚Äôs literally just 1 actual party. 

A lot of the members come from cities where being Filipino is a minority, so to have that community at UCSD and going to their workshops about allyship or mental health and events like high school conference and  learning things about my culture that I never knew before, etc is something that really appreciate and hopefully you find interest in going to those too.

First of all it's trust the process, not trust the system
Second of all, that is what pairing is like. A process. Not a system. The board that does the pairings tirelessly work to do them in the best interest of the kuyas ates and adings. People probably like you that only write one worded answers make the whole process a lot more difficult. How are they supposed to know how to pair you if all you write is that you are afraid of spiders or some shit. Open up for fucks sake, talking about your vulnerabilities isn't taboo.  Do you even know WHICH board does pairing? Are you aware of what is actually going on behind the scenes or is your petty attitude slipping out of your ass and on to facebook. How about YOU be a fucking adult and tell someone face to face your concerns.

7934,2018-12-08 18:22:06,"I used to want to be more than just a friend to someone from high school I knew. I‚Äôve always seen her more than just a friend of mine. I‚Äôve always looked up to her and aspired to be someone like her every day of my life since meeting and getting to know her. 

But I chose not to tell her my feelings because I knew I would not be ready for a relationship with everything coming at me at once. I told myself she was just a creation of my imagination; a facade that I created. I mean I really didn‚Äôt know her that well right? And she probably didn‚Äôt feel the same way anyway. And how would family and friends feel about this?  I had too many excuses that justified that she would be better off without me. And I still live in denial to this day.

Yet as the years pass by, she has become more distant from me. She‚Äôs now staff in a club that I‚Äôm not comfortable in which just makes her seem much farther away. We no longer seem to share anything in common anymore. I no longer have feelings for her but I live in pain knowing I let her go. 

I‚Äôm sorry Jade Tran. On the sidelines, I‚Äôve watched you grow so much as a person. You are someone that sees the world in the future. Don‚Äôt dwell on the past because of this confession. Don‚Äôt try to find out who I am. Chances are, you know who I am already. But if anything, I was the one that made the mistake of falling for you during my emotional roller coaster. And I‚Äôm certain that if we were to have been together, I would still be a hinderance to your growth which is something I don‚Äôt want to happen.

Someday, maybe our paths will cross again. But I‚Äôm still riding out this wild emotional roller coaster of mine. But maybe when I‚Äôm ready, I‚Äôll contact you.  Maybe ask to meet up again and catch up to just hang out. to see how times have been to you, to see how you feel, and maybe even if you have a boyfriend and if he‚Äôs treating you well. 

Until then, I hope that your friends, your club, your family, and other loved ones treat you well and that they act as the fertilizer for your success. Because I know damm well that you can do anything you could ever want, that you‚Äôll grow past the stars, and that you‚Äôll live your life in eternal bliss‚Ä¶without me. Good bye Jade Tran.

I never wanted to catch feels and get hurt again but here I am, falling way too hard. He doesn‚Äôt even know haha. I guess I‚Äôll just need some time to be okay. He even knows I‚Äôve been slightly depressed lately, he just doesn‚Äôt know that this is part of the reason.

Anyways here are the rankings
KP (God tier, if u aint with it u aint it chief. Also u got wholesome and unwholesome in the same package so its lit. Parties are lit, gbms are lit, but everything is organized very well so even if something goes wrong theres always something or someone there to assist.Also cameron is hot so theres that and i love me some filipino culture so theres also that )
VSA + KASA (great value KP with more ching chongers but low key more fun and inclusive and daddy chris is still around so if u over 18 shoot ur shot and tryna fuck cause he makes bank and has a 6 pack and will take you to raves üòòüòò and if not his brother kevin is also around and if u going to edc hit him up cause hes a fine ass snacc thats underrated just cause hes a young 4th year. If thats not for u we got jenny from 64 for all u thirsty ass bois out there, only reason shes not on SAD is cause she'd get too many dms. If not u got sum kasa bois but theyre all fine so it doesnt even matter who u choose u still finna get dicked down harder than bill dicked down monica )
CASA+TASA (wholesome but not, clique but not, a good org but not, this aint it chief, tried once died inside once this aint the place to be)
JSA (its not like the animes :c )
MASA (only reason its low is cause they too wholesome which isnt bad but its not the place to be if u tryna get lit or have fun at parties, as an extrovert i think theyre nice but im too outgoing and im not tryna tell ppl i got lit off of drinking water while playing catan for 17 hours)

I met this person at a party (we're both guys) and I did the usual small talk to find out his hobbies, interests, and plans in the future, so everything is fine right? It was kind of awkward, and I'd chalk it to myself because breaking ice is something I'd rather avoid but everything was fine. A bit later into the party we'd hang out and talk to other people, and I get this weird vibe from this dude, some sort of social ineptness? Whenever someone else would be talking, he would say something really off-beat or inappropriate to the conversation, for example:

(Random person is A, he's B)
A: So yeah when I was walking down the Promenade with my friends we saw a group of guys speeding down in their lambo-
B: What kind of wheels did they have?
A: Huh?
B: ... well what wheels did the cars have?
A: Uh, I don't remember sorry... Anyway, well they ran three red ligh-
B: How can you remember the car but not even the wheels?
A: I don't understand?

And at this point I kind leave quietly and talk to some other people there, and person A also makes some excuse to leave the conversation. Later on when the host of the party started to announce some sort of ice-breaker game (think like talking to other people across the table from you in the dining area about your favorite etc etc), and this dude finds me again and decides to sit next to me. Well at least since he's beside me I'm not really going to talk to him, right? As it turns out I had to listen to his conversation because the other side of the long table rotates while our side stayed put, and in every conversation he'd make some sort of awkwardly self-deprecating remark and weave in some niche jokes he has and I'd just watch the other person smile awkwardly too. At the end of it he tries approaching me again and this time I stop trying to entertain him and straight up leave to talk to other people. 

Am I an asshole?

 I feel like this dude has aspergers or something and has trouble with communicating with others, but I felt like I was just babysitting someone and being some sort of designated driver for everyone else to not come into a conversation with him. I'd have some nice talks with other people but he'd always try to come into my circle and include a random joke about killing himself (these jokes can be funny at the right times but he wasn't hitting any of those right times) and everything just gets awkward. Like I get it, don't call him out struggling with talking but at the same time who would actually enjoy someone's company when you don't click with them, even less barely manage to tolerate how they talk?

7830,2018-12-06 19:01:09,"TLDR: HDH is toxic to its student workers and CHECK YOUR FOOD. 

Working for HDH is legitimately hell. All places are always understaffed, so you can have the same students opening at 6:30am or closing at 11:30pm/1:30am three to four times a week -sometimes even both in one day (it adds up). Student workers are slammed almost every shift because we are regularly scheduled shortstaffed. 

All the promises HDH says is a lie. They are not flexible at all. Sure, they will schedule you during your free hours but have fun working till 1:30am when you have an 8am the next day or working from 6:30am till 9:30am when you have a class at 10am. You only get to call off twice a quarter. If you get sick last minute but have already called off twice, you're shit out of luck and have to go in anyways unless you can get last minute coverage (and you still have to bring in a doctors note). Also, no student worker is allowed to call off work during finals week. 

Sometimes the milk that we use to make coffee is past its expiration date. There is no quality check for any food. I've seen moldy food, food with flies, etc, put on the shelf. Unless the vegetables/fruits are visibly rotting on the outside, we do not clear them out. They literally stay there until someone buys it or it rots completely. If you buy bad food, bring it back and they will refund you. Highkey I would never eat at Pines again (understaffed + high traffic = corners are being cut somewhere)

The careers, the people that work full time, create a really toxic work environment for the new hires. If any of the newbies make a mistake they'll rip them a new one. Newbies also receive like no formal training and they are just bossed around like they should already know everything.  

There is honestly a lot more than just this but overall if you are thinking about working for HDH, don't. It's not worth it, you can get a much better experience and higher paycheck elsewhere. ",,,,Thu,14.0,9.0,71.3749999999999,36.5000000000001,50.25000000000007,0.095,0.826,0.079,-0.7276,19

I think to some girls who don't talk smack its nice to be with them, and if you ever get red flags that someone is toxic, just leave. Because if they can do it to someone else, then they can/ will do it to you too. Flee before its too late.

But I've befriended someone who turned our social/friend group against me. There were red flags, but I did not isolate myself enough to brace myself for the danger. I ignored what she said about some other girls, and soon enough it happened to me. Everyone knows how she has anger issues, and low key toxic, but everyone still is great friends with her, while I'm just isolated and badmouthed, pretty much unfriended because of her. It's frustrating and hard to see people like that thrive while you're thrown down. What she did in the end was toxic and borderline bullying, but ofc, bullies never see themselves as wrong, which is the frustrating part.

Anyone else think music is too powerful of a medium to be taken lightly? like I think its wrong (to a certain extent) if the only purpose of making music is to make money. And I feel that that's what quite a few popular musical artists have become or always have been from the start. 

i think that the intentions to create music should be purely wanting to make sounds (or lack thereof) that they genuinely find beautiful AND meaningful (i think there needs to be both). Like music made with this intention i think are the best songs of all time regardless of what genre it is. Music is a medium that can (imo better than other mediums such as poems, essays, paintings, etc.) efficiently communicate emotions, arguments, ideas, etc. and this should be taken advantage of to its full capacity. And i dont think some popular artists do this at all, and they simply make music to make money or gain popularity. 

I guess I personally just value genuineness a lot haha and dont respect people's DECISION (only, not the individual themselves) pursue a lot of money and keep it (like if i had a lot of money, I would give it all of it away immediately to those who desperately need it right now rather than investing it and contributing to the economy because i think making sure everyone has adequate living conditions RIGHT NOW is more important than growing our economy and hoping this growth provides better living conditions for the poor.)

So I've been proposed this definition that racism is when the majority in power discriminates the minority, which by the way is a very horrible definition but I will roll with it. And I've seen this in Berkeley where you guys straight up denied access on the road to white people thinking it's not racism because they're white and the majority. 

What you don't understand is that in Japan, we do the exact same thing. We even have a hand signal for it where we cross our arms to indicate that white people are not allowed in our restaurant, inn, taxi's or businesses. but guess what, in Japan, white people are the minority. So your definition allows it so that the exact same actions discriminating the exact same ethnicity can be done in one country and not be racist, but then can be done in another country and be hella racist. And we don't have to stop there. You honestly think that white people are the majority in Mexico, or Africa? and do you honestly believe that people in Mexico and Africa are not as hostile if not more hostile to white people than you guys who believe in this double standard racism are? Ya, the exact same thing you guys do to white people, you do it in Africa or Mexico, by that stupid definition of racism, it's racist. but for some reason, when it's in America, it's okay. 

How horrible is that? for racism to be determined by your geographic and your demographic? how horrible is that that all it takes is to change locations for an act of hate to be an acceptable act of righteousness?  

And believe me, I am no white man. and I do not for a second buy that white people have it any than a black person or a latino person. but goddamnit racism is NOT algebra. you do not just cancel out racism by being racist in the opposite direction. The way you stop racism is you stop being racist yourself, and you promote others to stop being racist. and when I say racist, I don't mean that stupid definition above with majority and privileges, I mean the REAL definition. When I say racism, I mean discriminating against anybody just because of their race and not the content of their character. That's what needs to stop. and I don't care if the person you're discriminating against is the privileged majority or the deprived minority, it is not okay. not now or ever.

7653,2018-12-02 18:20:33,"Response involving @7543 and @7609
Since there‚Äôs been at least two questions regarding it, I wanted to throw my two cents on the whole fat girl issue and then explain. 

First of all, I am a guy who prefers fat girls. Yes we do exist, and we‚Äôre probably not what you think we are.

Off the bat, I need to say that, at least in my case, this preference isn‚Äôt something definite to mean that any girl who is fat is immediately sexy. In my life, I have been attracted to thinner girls as well-it‚Äôs just that I tend to find the softness and curves of a bigger girl sexier. I also need to explain that there is not just one kind of fat girl. For some reason, idiotic people like @7543 will just group anyone with more body fat than average together as just ‚Äúfat people‚Äù. At least for me, a fat admirer (Usually known online as a FA), this is beyond narrow-minded. Women, fat or skinny, come in so many different shapes and sizes and everyone has different preferences for the ideal distribution of (Or lack of) fat is. What I‚Äôm trying to say is that just because people like me say we like fat girls doesn‚Äôt mean than anyone with a big belly (Don‚Äôt call it fupa. It makes you sound even more like an asshole btw), or a phat booty will be attractive to an FA; it can help, but it isn‚Äôt the end all. At least in my case, I personally think that facial features and height are of greater priority when determining how physically attractive a girl is than just how fat they are. However, this isn‚Äôt the case for all those who are prefer fat people which leads me to my next point.

The reason that FAs like myself are so afraid to proverbially, ‚Äúcome out of the closet‚Äù is because of the enormous stigmas around our preference. And this is mostly due in part to the associations that FAs have with fat fetishism. If I would even mention that I liked fat girls to my guy friends, they would immediately not only make fun of me, but think that I was only into really big girls. The stigma is never thought of as that you like thicc girls, or girls with a few extra pounds-you must like morbidly obese girls or girls whose weight is detrimental to their health. Therefore, you are a sicko and gross. In terms of girls, if an FA were to tell them that they thought they were hot or that they liked larger women, they would run-simple as that. That‚Äôs because most big girls know about the small percentage of ‚Äúfeeders‚Äù out there who gain sexual pleasure from their girl grotesquely gaining weight. And I don‚Äôt mean to fetish shame, but most girls should be scared-that‚Äôs crazy unhealthy and wrong. Because of these really strong associations with very, very negative sexual appetites, people who just like fat girls the way they are risk a whole lot when coming out. And when coupled with the whole ‚Äúyou must like all fat people‚Äù stigmatism I talked about earlier, it makes it tough to just come out and tell people ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a guy who like fat girls‚Äù like @7609 requests. Part of me wanted to make this whole soapbox speech public but I knew I couldn‚Äôt. Maybe someday, but not now.

So in the end I want to tell fat girls that there are good guys who will love you and your curves for all eternity. It‚Äôs a rough community I‚Äôm not going to lie-but just know that you can be loved and thought of as beautiful just as anyone else can be : )",,"trigger warning, serious, kinky",,Sun,34.0,37.0,84.42000000000016,127.46999999999987,85.05000000000018,0.06,0.788,0.152,0.9957,18

7647,2018-12-02 12:43:17,"Triton Gaming is probably the biggest cesspool of a student org on campus. 

They're basically an unofficial fraternity, except worse in a lot of ways. The worst part is that they refuse to acknowledge or admit that anything's wrong. Despite being an organization for video games, I've never seen a higher concentration of ravers and drug abusers in one place. I've seen innocent young freshman turn into cocaine addicts directly due to being part of the club. In most organizations, you can just say ""I want to join"" and become part of the fun, but really the only way to ""join"" Triton Gaming is to interview to become an officer ‚Äîwhich is essentially rushing a frat, with a recruitment period, initiation and hazing included. Otherwise, it's a cliquey mess that'll remind you of those high school dramas on TV. The amount of gossip and rumors that get passed around is absolutely mind boggling. The closest thing to being a general member you can get is by paying them for a piece of plastic with a logo so you can get imaginary points at their events. And even if you just try hanging out with the members like a regular person, they'll shit talk the people behind their backs, making every effort to exclude them until they stop showing up.

And you'd think that a gaming organization would be overwhelmingly male, since that's the primary demographic for gamers. But the org will basically take in any cute girl, turning into a pathetic hunting ground for their attention. Good luck getting in if you're a male who isn't already friends with someone inside. They stalk female applicants social media as an unofficial part of their application process, commenting on how they look as if they're grocery shopping. Some of the female members don't even play games, in an exclusive gaming club. Guys will pick up girls as littles just to get a chance to sleep with them, and no one seems to have a problem with that. Their ""families"" are just an incestuous dating platform. 

Even structurally, they're just a monopoly of several orgs, breaking the rules that other orgs have to follow left and right. They have a separate organization for each game, but really that's just so they can book more rooms and get an office to themselves. They've figured out the funding system to a T, taking campus money that's meant to give money to support events, but instead they use the money to buy lunch and dinner for the officers. Half their organizations don't hold a general meeting like they're supposed to every quarter, and don't even do anything besides support the main organization. The confusing part is that if you join one of their ""orgs"" but not the main one, they won't even really consider you part of the org unless you've specifically joined Triton Gaming. 

The coolest part of Triton Gaming is probably all their sponsorships, which provides them with a lot of the prizing.

It starts, of course, at childhood. They all share one similar thing, they don't socialize well. They turn to video game, fantasy, weeb, and/or online culture --anywhere where they can find an escape from reality, establishing one of the foundations of this culture, anonymity. 

When they're in an escape from reality, they don't tend to exercise that much. Playing video games all day or watching anime doesn't exactly get you fit, and hence a majority of them are either overweight or underweight, and they definitely do not have any muscle mass. They are weak, and because of it they strive for something they believe that makes them unique, more purposeful than their peers and counter parts (the jocks/chads) intelligence. Whether they are actually smarter than the average Joe or not doesn't really matter. This is why all or a majority of the people in the societal reject culture have some autistic fascination with intellectual superiority, and once again establishing this foundation of the culture.

This fascination with intellectual superiority comes in several forms. For instance fedoras come from the idealistic renditions of the ""classic men,"" one that culturally superior than the current counter parts. Another is being a jackass religious atheist (i.e. that guy that's like ""OH, YOU ACTUALLY BELIEVE IN JESUS?!??"".)

Most of this stuff usually occurs around or post puberty. With puberty, comes sexualization. This is when their hatred becomes internalized and targeted towards women, since a majority of their interaction with any person in real life in a non professional/family setting is generally targeted towards girls because they are trying to get some action. Of course, most girls are not into them because of several different reasons, and decline. First impressions usually leave a lasting impression. They cope, and this is where some of the culture splits, some thinking that the issue is not with them because it's impossible in their minds (I mean if you're the most intelligent being on this planet, who wouldn't love you). For incels, they think it's because of their physical appearance. For nice guys, they think its because girls like assholes or something similar to that aspect. All these lays the last foundation for this culture, misogyny.

It was a very special time in my life, and I‚Äôm still processing how to feel‚Ä¶still trying to accept that people change and want other things. 

To answer a few of your questions:
Things ended because he thought we were too different of people to continue. I think somewhere deep down in my heart I know it too, I‚Äôm just not 100% convinced. He wanted someone more on his career path, (we‚Äôre both engineers but different kinds) as he felt like that‚Äôs the area to have a connection that matters most to him. To be honest, everything else was fine. We had different views but similar life values, so we taught each other a lot about the world. 

We made a promise the first day we met that where ever this led us, we would try to remain friends, because a connection like this is too big to sacrifice. (As cliche and naive as that sounds.) I still talk to him every few days and we‚Äôre going to a concert to see our favorite artist (of all time, the one we bonded over) together this summer. It‚Äôs just things have changed, and will take some getting used to. It hurts but maybe this is a time to reflect on myself. 

I still can‚Äôt believe that so many of you read our story, and I might release a few more memories as I start to get over it. I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôre getting back together this time ;( We‚Äôve been through a lot. From dealing with cheating to stress from school getting in the way (I‚Äôm surprised we didn‚Äôt break up from these things), it‚Äôs all been a rollercoaster ride. I thought one day I‚Äôd get to make dinner for him in our home, after we both came back from work. I actually thought I might marry this boy, and he did too. But that has all changed. I‚Äôm still try to convince myself that people who love each other deeply can not end up together. ",,,,Fri,12.0,8.0,63.881999999999906,46.115999999999964,64.13400000000003,0.044,0.826,0.13,0.982,10

7447,2018-11-27 22:03:18,"tldr; trying to get over my boyfriend. A compilation of our adventures on campus. Feel free to comment on the stupid shit I did, it might make me feel better.   

Just ended things with my boyfriend and best friend. He was my first and what we had was wildly special and rare. But I thought I‚Äôd share our year long escapade on campus. You can try to guess what college we‚Äôre in, but there‚Äôs not a college on campus we don‚Äôt have a story in. Baby I know you will see this, and I hope at least one of these makes you laugh or smile. So here it goes:

The first night we hung out, I was crazy enough to say I‚Äôd go out with you. Our first week of dating consisted of us talking all night and listening to music, that we would end up both sleeping in the dorm lounge (I had never met anyone with a relatively similar music taste to mine until you). In fact, 3 of the first 4 days we were together you stayed the night. The other night, you stroked my hair until I fell asleep in the lounge and covered me with a sweater. That was only after knowing you for less than 48 hours (I should‚Äôve thought you were a creep and ran away). A week later, the resident advisors said to not have friends sleep over in the common area, I tried so hard to hold in my laughter at this meeting because I knew they were referring to us, but we never got caught because no one had known who we were yet. 

We later convinced someone to let us into the village study room that first weekend together, and ended up sleeping there all night. We even shared our first kiss there. You thought you could wait to take me to Fallen Star that Tuesday to kiss me, but you just couldn‚Äôt wait. Remember how cold it was and I was a freshie who couldn‚Äôt find a bathroom, so I ran across the street and peed in a bush? I had quite the courage back then; and you were still into me even after that. To the guys who found us there in the morning and congratulated my bf, nothing happened. That day was both our first walk of shame. 

That week we also looked at the stars from Marshall field‚Ä¶until the sprinklers went off on us and I thought we were in a movie. (Although this also happened to us on the old fields by AP&M.) We moved to the side where there was no sprinklers, and the security guard just stared at us. I was so self conscious, but you had a way to calm me down and make me laugh. (I‚Äôm thankful to all the security this year who let us be.) 

After just a few weeks together, on Thursday night, we took a sleeping bag and slept in it together on RIMAC field. (So to the guy who asks if he can take a walk outside at 3am and to the other OP who asks if they can walk on RIMAC field here is your answer.) We set an alarm to get out of there early, thinking we wouldn‚Äôt be seen, but instead got woken up by maintenance mowing the lawn. That was the day I learned you sleep like a log. I was so embarrassed and scrambled to get out of the cold wet field. What freaks we probably looked like carrying a sleeping bag across campus. 

I didn‚Äôt know how much I loved the thrill of sneaking around until I met you. Let me remind you of a few of my favorite memories, that probably got all jumbled into a blur with the rest of our year.

Something we tend to forget, is when we made out on the Muir field triton emblem, just hours before the school wide fire drill. We probably only got 2 hours of sleep before that fire alarm went off. 

We also made out in our department‚Äôs conference room and stairwells. (I‚Äôm glad we never got caught and decided to divide business and pleasure.) One day you‚Äôre going to have a meeting in that conference room and you‚Äôre gonna blush about us stumbling over each other there in the dark‚Ä¶I‚Äôve already had a conference there so I know what it feels like. 

We also once tried to pull an all nighter in the doghouse at Sixth but we fell asleep, until the security found us and woke us up. They asked me to wake up my boyfriend and you were passed out af. 

I remember we went to the woods one night and you were terrified. This night was the first time things got really spicy. I think you tripped over a branch while you tried to take off my shirt. I‚Äôve never seen you scramble so fast for your clothes like when that group of people went down there to smoke. I‚Äôm pretty sure you put your shirt on inside-out.

I also remember very early in the year when you took me to 6th floor of Geisel to study and I swore never to come back because I hated the silence. I had tried to avoid Geisel, and you gave me more reason to. You left me with your stupid Altoids box while you tried to find better WiFi connection. Dumbly I went searching for you with the mint box jingling as I walked the entire floor. Little did we know later that summer we‚Äôd be in one of those study rooms making out, without a care in the world. 

Years down the road, I‚Äôll still remember when we snuck into the Marshall Sequoyah discussion rooms after hours and talked about family and life. We were probably there longer than all the times I went there for my math discussion that quarter.

I wanted to reach every rooftop and view on campus by the end of the school year, and baby I bet we did. We watched the sunset from the top floor of Rady. We talked many times on the trail in Warren behind CV with our hands intertwined, overlooking the canyon. As well as shared many kisses on those steps. (This was my happy place on days I could not see you.) We later found out about the rooftop on HSS & AP&M (not an original spot) but this became a regular for us, and was still a thrill. 

But not as much of a rush as the night we went to the PC balcony. What a view that was when we sat on your blanket and looked at the moon. We stayed there way past closing time and were locked inside PC. I was clutching your hand so tightly as I whispered, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre gonna get caught. They‚Äôre gonna have us on video, or there‚Äôs a silent alarm‚Äù, as we walked out. (A few weeks later they locked the balcony, and I wondered if it was because of us.) 

My favorite day of the week was Friday, not necessarily because it was the end of the school week, but because of Friday night dinners and ice cream with you. On the weekends we would spend all day focused on a couch doing schoolwork, not talking just exchanging music every now and then, because after we would relax and watch movies together. Weekends were the best, because you were the last thing I fell asleep to and the first person I woke up to. I‚Äôm gonna miss your arms holding me under the layers of blankets, and being lazy with you. 

I‚Äôll miss getting Goody‚Äôs and eating lunch at the hammocks in the sunshine. I‚Äôm never gonna forget that day we ditched school to walk down to the beach. To the summertime lunches on top of the Revelle Keeling apartments. I still vividly remember watching the sunset together on the 4th of July there. When a group of summer program students came by we snuck to the 7th floor and watched it there instead. I snapped a few pictures of you looking out at the sunset shortly before you swept your hands on to my hips and we stood and watched the colors dance across the sky.

We used to go on walks through ERC and stop on the rooftop of Cafe V looking down in the business of life inside. We also laid on the grass outside, nearby the laundry rooms, and that was the first place you told me about your ex. I hope I don‚Äôt become a story like her one day. 

When you would take me home, I used to make you take me the long way so I could see the neon word lights at Powell. We spent so many nights outside shivering and exploring campus. I feel sorry for the countless Triton Rides we had to call, when it got too late and we were just a little too delirious. 
Wandering around with you was the best. My favorite adventure was when we visited Fallen Star in the summer. I was in love with how excited and amazed you were as you smiled down at the view. What I would give to go back in time to that moment. Or any of these moments. I‚Äôm gonna love you for a while baby. I hope that‚Äôs okay.

I‚Äôve been dealing migraines since a bit before college but this year they got quite debilitating so I went ahead to see a headache specialist. I got an MRI and well lucky me, they found the reason why these migraines are worse than the ones I‚Äôve had before. 

Oh well, I‚Äôm gonna try to freshen up my outlook on life and be more positive, more excited about life for the rest of my final year in college. Someone used to tell me I was fake pessimist or something (and maybe I was lol I never really understood what he meant) but I have definitely been an absolute cynic this past year. 

BUT I‚Äôm gonna change! I‚Äôm gonna go back to being the me that was super positive and super happy and hopefully this will reflect in what I do. I‚Äôm not gonna let the things that have been bothering me lately bother me anymore. I‚Äôll be funnier than I am (ngl I‚Äôm pretty fucking funny). I‚Äôll smile like I used to. I‚Äôll try to be kinder and more generous. I‚Äôll panic about midterms and finals, I‚Äôll relax, I‚Äôll go clubbing, I‚Äôll take the mcat, I‚Äôll graduate almost maybe cum laude and I‚Äôll say goodbye to the wonderful people I have been privileged to know and to call my friends and pretend I won‚Äôt miss them too much. Or at least I‚Äôll try huehehuehehuehue

I‚Äôm not close enough to my closest friends here anymore to tell them what‚Äôs up fucked up with my brain lol so I‚Äôll just enjoy anonymity and tell all of UCSD instead. I‚Äôm not tryna do anything too drastic about it treatment wise until after June. probably not a death sentence, but yeah lol laughter is the best medicine and what not so I‚Äôll try to laugh without inhibition from now on xx

Everything I eat that's not dry kale or cauliflower is scrutinized and she never wants to go try new places to eat with me unless they're those healthy ones. I mean I like that kinda food too, but it gets old after going to the same ones every week. And then she always passively makes me feel like shit for craving an ""unhealthy food item"" like pizza. We haven't eaten pizza in 2 months and even then, it was cauliflower-crust! In addition to that bs, she's always at the gym-which is fine as I go there too (Not at the same time usually though due to scheduling) but as you can probably figure out, it's ALL the time now. She'll go multiple times a day sometimes so I barely even get to see her. When I ask if she's trying to avoid being around me or would like to take a break, she claims that she still loves me. And when we're together we do occasionally have good fun (And good sex). But tbh,  I think she's more in love with her bony-ass body since she never seems to walk-the-walk in wanting to spend time with me and especially want to enjoy life with me. It's just such a shame since I love her so much and we have so much history.

So I decided to try and have a proper relationship with the guy. I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm ready, but I want to give it a shot. I‚Äôm excited, but also kinda terrified. I‚Äôve talked with him about this, and he‚Äôs said he‚Äôs scared too so at least we‚Äôre in it together.

There‚Äôs the obvious fear of coming out, but I‚Äôm also afraid of losing a friend if this doesn‚Äôt work out, I‚Äôm  afraid of hurting him, and I‚Äôm afraid that I‚Äôll always wonder what it might have been like to date a girl since I haven‚Äôt done that yet.

7148,2018-11-19 11:07:37,"When You Watch Your Ex Get Married

Suddenly she was there. The girl you introduced me to in passing, the cute ginger one, smiling, laughing, all done up with you holding her hand with a ring on the left hand. I close the window on my computer but the image is already burned into my mind. You‚Äôre getting married, and it‚Äôs not to me. 

The night we broke up, you cried as you detailed the proposal, a Disneyland parade with lights and fireworks and everything you know I love with all my heart and could never say no to. The date you told me it would happen has long past, but you described it so vividly I remember it as if we actually were engaged at some point. Maybe that‚Äôs why this hurts. 

I know I‚Äôll see the photos. One day I‚Äôll be browsing and see you in a suit, probably the same one you wore to your sister‚Äôs wedding, but it‚Äôll be you at the altar instead. It‚Äôll be her in the white gown walking down the aisle with happy tears and beaming smiles, anticipating a life with you, the one that was promised to me so many years ago. I didn‚Äôt want it then, and I don‚Äôt want it now, but for some reason I still remember what it felt like when you bought me flowers just because. When you drove an hour out of your way to bring me my favorite drink at work, or kidnapped me from class just to drive around dirt roads and blast music when I was sad. I ended it, and I needed to at the time, but now that I‚Äôm a little more grown I recognize that it was those kinds of things that convinced me that you loved me, maybe even a little bit. 

I hope you surprise her at work with a soundtrack of her favorite songs and dozen bouquets of roses.
I hope you have big dreams of travelling to Europe together for the summer and spending a week in Spain just because. 
I hope you took out all your anxieties and insecurities on me so she‚Äôd never have to feel them. 
I hope you don‚Äôt shake her like a doll when you get upset. 
I hope her wrists are free of bruises and scars from you pinning her to a cold concrete floor.
I hope she doesn't spend her afternoons sobbing in your bathroom listening the splintering of wood as you tear down the door.
I hope your hands never touch her throat and leave her crying for air and a sense of sanity. 
I pray you gave me all the high and lows of bliss to bad moments, so she could have only your best self.

You're getting married, and it's not to me, but God am I the lucky one.  ",,,,Mon,17.0,12.0,100.7170000000002,75.5,90.29799999999989,0.087,0.71,0.203,0.9965,11

My bf is not a bad person, but he has made mistakes in the past which stuck with me and I can't seem to get over. He's been really jealous and controlling and would always want to know where I was or look at my snap map multiple times. I always put up with him but I did speak up and told him it bothered me. He's gotten upset at me multiple times for stupid stuff, but when I came to college it just went past what I could manage. I was with my mum, spending time with her as I would not be able to see her for a month until her next visit (I'm an international student and the flight is 9+ hours away). I told him I was currently with her (as I always tell him what I'm currently doing so he knows if I'm busy or not) and a few minutes later he got upset that I was only replying to him on one social media and not on the others where he had left messages as well (sent me memes on instagram dms, snaps as well but I was just replying through text). We would constantly fight about stuff like this that I consider so immature, but this time it really triggered me because it involved my mum. Whenever I talk to him about how the stuff that he does upsets me he does apologise sincerely and honestly, and his usual lines are ""I'm sorry babe, I promise I will get better for you, please don't lose faith in me"". To be honest he has gotten better and even though there's some things that still bother me, I have no complaints at the moment. Thing is, I find myself getting more irritated over every little thing, or if he asks something like ""Who's that guy in your story"" in the most transparent way I will get really defensive and assume he's jealous again. I know this is not right and I have been trying to work on myself and make things work out because he is a great guy and he knows how to grow as a person, but I don't know if I can get much more broken than what I already am. He's in a different continent too, and always says ""i'm coming mid [insert month]"" but he never does. I know this is none of my business because planning a trip is expensive, however I was clear enough with him from the beginning that I wouldn't be able to see him until my summer holidays 2019 and he's made me think he was coming to see me every month starting with july and cancelling last minute. I don't know how much longer I can wait, I haven't seen him since January last year, and I feel if I saw him face to face maybe all our issues could get solved (I've always believed face to face contact is the most sincere it can get) but its been 23 months already.

There's this cute/nice guy who has expressed that he'd like to pursue a long term relationship with me. We've messed around a few times in the past, but have never properly dated. I'm considering giving it a try, but dating a guy long term would ultimately require me to fully come out to family and friends (would not want to hide the relationship, effectively putting him back in the closet) and I'm not sure I'm ready for that (though I know I need to do it at some point).

Before this guy reached out and laid this on me I had been talking with an equally cute/nice girl, and we've hung out a few times. I'm not entirely sure she's interested, but I feel like something might be there and was considering pursuing a relationship with her.

Clearly I have to choose one or the other. This dude whose definitely interested or this girl who might be. Going for the person whose already made their intentions clear seems like the logical choice, but dating a girl would be far easier. And I know I'm probably an ass for considering that argument.

Just because people have different opinions or beliefs does not make them stupid. That goes both ways. Looking at both liberals and conservatives here. Things like that create partisanship. Just because someones a republican doesnt mean theyre racist. But also just because you say youre not racist, doesnt mean you arent. Just because you think what you believe in is right, doesnt entitle you to ridicule others for not thinking that way. If a Christian doesnt agree with abortion and thinks its murder, you cant be like ""How the fuck can you be so stupid its not murder and its not youre baby,"" you have to realize theres fundamental differences that make them think the way they do, and that has to entirely with the fact that in their bible its what they believe to be murder and it is in their moral responsibility to try and vote against it. The same way you have to respect the religious beliefs of every other major religion, you have to see where theyre coming from. Now Christians, you can't denigrate people for not believing in God  and not believing in the Bible, because just because you believe it doesnt mean that everyone else has to as well.

**disclaimer: sorry for not making this as gender inclusive as i could
and i'm sick of teaching my hook-ups what to do SO:

some sex tips:
FOR PLEASURING A FEMALE-IDENTIFYING PERSON/PERSON WITH A VAGINA/WOMAN:
grab her waist when you're making out with her and fucking her from behind
grab her hair **at the base** but not from the ends of the hair, which hurts in a bad way. you kinda wanna comb through her hair and scrunch it
before eating her out, make out with her a bit, kiss down her body, kissing her neck, boobs (fun!), stomach, inner thigh, teasing her before going down on her
once you're down there, keep your hands moving about! massage her legs, scratch down her back and make her writhe! stick your pointer finger in and make a ""come hither"" motion, not a PUMP IN AND OUT motion (unless she wants that!)
not used that often but pretty nice: play with the kit like you're rolling a dial, i suppose. like that dial on a desktop mouse?? you can use your pointer finger or **your thumb**! it's actually pretty nice!
when fucking her, try growling! it's really hot. it's a deep, gutteral noise. SUPER hot.
ask if she's into spanking! if she is: COOL do u know how nice it is to spank an ass? if not, that's ok~

FOR PLEASURING A MALE-IDENTIFYING PERSON/PERSON WITH A PENIS/MAN:
you can also grab his waist when you're going down on him! putting pressure at the hips increases his sensation.
boys like their hair pulled too! same as above ^
when going down on him, here are some things you can do:
1. suck his balls. just put the entire ball in your mouth and get it all wet. massage the other one.
2. PRESSURE. apply pressure while going up and down the shaft. add extra pressure as you look him in the eyes. 
3. with your tongue, flick the frenulum. its where the head and the shaft meet. super sensitive. flick the head in general. swirl your tongue around the head. give lots of attention to it. edge the fuck out of this boy.
4. just fuckin' commit to deep throating! just put it all in! YOU CAN DO IT. if you gag, even better cuz that'll cause a lot of drool, and isn't drool just the best?
5. while going down, also scratch down his back. he'll writhe. it's fun.

IN GENERAL:
offer to give them a massage~ we're all in pain, and it's sensual ykno
scratches down the back
light kissing, nibbling, and licking on the outer ear lobe (like along the ear.. pls dont lick inside the ear lol)
when making out, throw in a ""bite the lower lip""
BE VOCAL PLEASE
ask if they're into spanking, choking, biting (HARD biting), scratches, etc! if they are, COOLLLLL, you've found a fun sex buddy :D

So at the start of this quarter, as I was walking to class, I noticed a girl whom I had seen in at least one of my classes every quarter the previous year.  I know that because she actively participates in class and she seems popular too because it seems she‚Äôs always got a lot of friends to talk to.

Fast forward two or three weeks in the quarter, I was walking to that class when I hear someone say ‚Äúhi.‚Äù  I was listening to music with earphones so I‚Äôm not sure who said it or even if it was directed to me.  So I looked around and I noticed that same girl with two of her friends looking at me. I wasn‚Äôt sure if it was her that said ‚Äúhi‚Äù or if it was maybe directed to someone past me, so I just presumed it wasn‚Äôt for me and continued walking to class. It didn't seem like anyone said ""hi"" to her back.

I‚Äôve been thinking about that encounter for a while now and thinking now that it was very possible that she was trying to say ‚Äúhi‚Äù to me and try to get to know me. I feel awful that I just kept walking. But what do I do about it now?

Because our dynamic was very one-sided initially, I often get insecure that he's still looking at/talking to other girls. There are other reasons why, but it's too specific to my situation to confess. We've talked about it and he reassured me that he's not, and knowing how he is he probably isn't. Also, this is stalkery but there's this one girl I noticed he follows that's super pretty and dresses well and seems like she has a really cool personality. My intuition is she was a Tinder match for various reasons. Recently I quickly glanced at his phone as my eyes were wandering, and he was looking through his instagram dms and her icon was there near the middle/top and one of them sent a heart. Ok this is pretty stupid it was a split second and I'm overthinking probably, but is it ok for me to be so anxious about her? I can't tell if it's just because it's my first relationship and I'm just being insecure. I know I should stop checking up on her and my bf, but I can't help myself. Also, not to suck my own dick, but I'm pretty cute also a good person. I used to be ugly (lmfao) so a lot of insecurity stems from there, but I know I should be confident in myself too. I mean even I still have randoms and Tinder matches who dm me/reply to my IG stories too, but I don't have any intentions with them at all so it could be the same thing? I don't know if this is something I should just work on personally or something I should talk to him about so I can feel reassured. At the same time I don't want to tell him about her just because I don't wanna expose myself for stalking lol. I should also probably stop lurking.

We can talk about whether or not a flat tax would be beneficial and things of that matter but I shouldn't need to explain that prioritizing anything over human rights and equality is inherently immoral. I just want to slap every Republican in the face with this thing called ethics because yeah, if you vote for a racist, you inherently value racial equality less than whatever personal gain you'd get, which means you don't fucking prioritize racial equality and I'd say that's racist.

I didn't think much about this at first but I've realized she has been getting a lot of boys' snapchats from instagram and starting streaks with them. Then, I've seen her chatting other boys on snapchat and sending cute selfies of herself to them. I've seen her screenshot multiple snaps from other guys and even gave them different nicknames and emojis (like tongue). I've talked with her about it and she always changes the subject and simply just says ""we're just friends, don't worry about them"" which is hard for me to do given that she's so flirty with them. She also talks about her past relationships a lot too. She even went as far as comparing me with one of her exes which made me really upset and sad, that night I couldn't sleep. Maybe I'm thinking too much, but I just don't feel her true genuine affection for me and it's as if she's just keeping me around.

6955,2018-11-15 10:03:30,"(Excuse me for this serious, dramatic post but writing this here may be the best way for me to cope with a complicated situation I'm going through right now)

I was born with a twin brother. He passed away when we were around 4 years old. I never asked my parents the specifics as to what had happened as I knew it was an accident and not natural. However, after work last week I drank with my mother at dinner and we had a heart to heart moment (one of those intoxicated and unfiltered ones) and my mother told me something that has been on my mind every minute since. I brought up the topic of my brother and I saw my mother's demeanor instantly shift. She looked at me and with sad eyes told me that I murdered him. She said that it seemed that I had found a way to pry open the toddler stair gate and push him down the stairs to his death.

Immediately my mother began to cry and apologize for telling me, wondering why she did and I could tell she regretted it immediately, thinking I would not be able to handle the self blame. She told me to not feel guilty, that children make mistakes. However, I felt nothing. I told her it was fine, that I was happy she told me what had happened- and that we don't need to speak of it again.

The thing is, why this has been on my mind, is because I have conscious memory of my brother. Although it is distorted and the memories of a 4 year old are not to be taken as accurate- I do remember him. I remember his face and albeit our young age, a 4 year old does have significant cognition. I do not remember killing him though. I do not even remember the grief my parents had when finding his body. I only remember a few of the days following.

What is keeping me up at night is that I do not feel self blame or grief, learning that I am responsible for his death. My friends tell me I shouldn't as I was young and naturally irresponsible. However I disagree. I am sure, although I have no recollection, that it was a conscious decision in the moment. Those toddler staircase gates are not easy to open nor is it easy to push a toddler (as a toddler yourself) down a flight of stairs. Furthermore, I am concerned because I feel nothing. No guilt, no sadness, but I feel a strange combination of relief and fear. I am relieved of the questions surrounding what happened to him but now I am fearful of losing control again- should the circumstance arise.

I recently came to the conclusion that I don't trust my boyfriend. Why? I've noticed some things these past 2 months. 1. Whenever he's on snapchat, he'll show me the snaps that he gets from his guy friends. However, he won't open the ones that he gets from females in front of me. One of these females even has a purple heart by her name, which I know was not already preset. 2. He follows and likes images of all these nude or provocative women on instagram to the point where his whole feed is just nudes.This carries on to snapchat too. It's often enough that these women start becoming his ads (the creepy thing google does by showing you what you look at often).  I actually would not be very concerned about this because it's a normal guy thing, as with watching porn (he does do this as well). The thing about this that does not sit well is that he tries to hide it from me and the fact that he finds it harder to finish during intercourse now because of all the masturbating he does. 3. He talks about his exes a lot. He still has pictures of him and his exes saved, like one of those post shower pics. Am I just being over analytical about everything? I've been trying to not let it get to me this past month, but it drives me absolutely insane.

Many people think that he was the only creator of a lot of super heroes but that's not true. The silver age of comics in Marvel was created mainly by three people, these being Stan Lee, Jack Kirby, and Steve Ditko. Lee wasn't the sole creator, he didn't think of every idea and every concept by himself. There were more people into that. And I think it sucks that people don't even know who Jack Kirby or Steve Ditko were. For example I saw some photos as tribute towards Stan Lee and one had Thanos in it and Stan Lee didn't even created Thanos, Jim Starlin did. Another one is the last scene of Toy Story 3 where Andy gives the toys to the little girl but instead it was Stan Lee with Kevin Feige. Half of the characters that Stan Lee hands down to Kevin weren't even created by him such as Captain America, Scott Lang, Bucky, Thor and all of the new iteration of the Gotg except for Groot.

Now I am double majoring international business and psychology, they told me that I would not survive once I graduated since my majors are just not ""specialized"" or ""expertised"" enough. Also, since I am Asian, they told me I would not be better than a white person because I'm not creative enough or I do not understand American culture.
I mean wtf. Didn't I already prove my family wrong multiple times when I can speak fluent English and got into UCSD? I just hate how Asian parents always say bad things about children and make them feel so bad about themselves.

6826,2018-11-12 22:34:29,"So here goes a confession... I‚Äôve known for a long time that I have depression/anxiety, but lately it‚Äôs been worse than ever. I gain/lose weight constantly, either sleep too much/too little, can‚Äôt focus, and I just generally feel worn out all the time. I joined a sport this year because I‚Äôm athletic and missed being competitive on a team but I just don‚Äôt enjoy it anymore and I feel more stressed about acting like I still enjoy it. Ive been to therapy in the past; it helped get past some anxious situations, but overall I still felt the same. I‚Äôm leaning toward wanting medication or something but the thought of asking a doctor for that is so overwhelming I don‚Äôt know where to start or like if I even need it. Recently I changed my doctor to get help for some stomach issues (ulcers), and the new doctor asked if I had a history with these problems and I actually said yes. I‚Äôm going in for a follow up soon and I really want to articulate how I really feel, but when I‚Äôm in those types of situations (even in therapy) where I have to describe out loud what I struggle with I get so stuck and compensate for my problems. My parents tell me to get over the stuff I‚Äôve hinted at to them because it‚Äôs just me vs my mind but I‚Äôm at an end where I‚Äôm just so exhausted and overwhelmed and not myself anymore that it‚Äôs hard to get over it by just thinking through it like I might have been able to do in the past. A lot of people here probably think I‚Äôm a very awkward&shy girl but really I can be very outgoing, it‚Äôs just I‚Äôm so exhausted with going through the motions and dealing with increasing stress that I just shut down.

P.S. To all the people who could have voted but just ""Didn't like Hillary Clinton"" this is your fucking fault. ",,political,,Mon,6.0,20.0,11.680000000000016,64.88,33.83999999999994,0.177,0.761,0.063,-0.98,15
