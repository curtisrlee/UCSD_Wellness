I feel so lost and out of place in my lab. I don't have a strong background in the stuff I'm learning because I learned only the basics of it during high school, and UCSD doesn't offer an undergrad class on it. My mentor encourages me to ask questions but I kind of feel that they're not the best at explaining theories behind certain things; kind of like the TAs who are smart and friendly, but aren't the best at explaining things to you. I'm finding myself in a spiral in which I get anxious about not knowing the theories and concepts in lab, which produce even more anxiety about other stuff such as making silly mistakes in lab, and that getting worse, on and on. Oftentimes I'm so lost I don't know where to start when asking things, which make me feel very awkward talking to my mentor. I do have other resources like asking other grad students in my lab or googling/looking at Youtube videos on certain topics. I definitely use the Internet often to learn more about something, but I feel that it's not enough. I do talk to the other graduate students, but since they're not specifically mentoring me, I feel a little limited.

I’m fortunate to have lived on the more privileged side of society,  am fairly attractive, obtain various leadership positions and internships, in a good sorority, and travel occasionally. The outside always appears better. 
    I have generalized anxiety disorder and every few months get very depressed (crying in my car for hours after midnight type depressed). 
    My family life has been rough. My mom was severely abused by both of her parents, and until this day, my grandma manages to emotionally abuse my mom the 1-2 times she sees her every year (she lives abroad). My mom and dad are both individually good people, but are awful together. My dad controls my mom, cheated on her, and bad mouthed her. My mom has emotionally abused him. My mom has also severely emotionally and mentally abused me growing up, and continues to do so sometimes until this day. She also shows obvious favoritism to my little sister. The details of that would be another post, but let’s just say she sees herself in my sister, thus tries to live through her, giving my sister a more loving upbringing, while I was always shut down and villianized. Although my dad is a bad husband, he’s only been a good father to my siblings and me.
    I’ve also been sexually assaulted 3 times...well, by 3 different people. My ex sexually abused me various times.    
     I’ve been seeing an AMAZING therapist for 2 years, that’s helped me so so much. I am a healthier person and I am no longer afraid I’ll be the same kind of partner/parent as my parents. But it still sucks, a lot. 
    I know I wasn’t physically abused but the kind of mental torture and verbal harassment I endured sucks. My mom doesn’t know better due to her upbringing. I’m writing this to vent and to also raise awareness that you truly don’t know what someone goes through.

I got into a long distance relationship with a guy just before I started school here. I broke up with him because of the lack of communication between us and lies..? I've been feeling really depressed about this, so I'm going to write out my thoughts. I guess, I just need to relieve myself of my doubts or just need reassurance.. Idk. 

Our relationship was good from mid Aug to end of Sept. Things got shady (from his side), we would argue about small matters like calling and video calling (he didn't want to), he would only text me once a month in October & November, then in December he came online twice (this was when I broke it off with him; fyi, I would've broken up with him earlier, but he would only text me/come online during his afternoon, which was past my midnight). His reason, as to why he barely had time to text/call his girlfriend (me) was because his dad was in the hospital after having a heart attack and needed to stay because he had some heart issues, then in December he texted me that his dad died, his sister was suicidal, and he's a mess and has been missing uni. Then the following two weeks, he came online again (in December), I broke up with him.. Afterwards, he would be online a ton, he found his comfort talking to my friends. I missed him, so I asked him to come back.. but then my doubts bothered me even more. So, I broke up with him on January 13th and went offline social media until I felt okay. 

Because he would decline to call/video call me so much, I ended up having doubts about him and thinking about what if's, more than actually studying. That quarter, I resulted with a C and 2 F's. While being in a relationship with him, I felt lonely, sad, and tired of everything. I started to binge eat and gave up on working out (because in my head, I thought what if he texts me and I'm busy.. I need to talk to him when he's online), so I basically gave up my reality waiting for him you can say. (Wow, my life actually sounds so sad while writing this out). After we broke up (in Jan.), I went offline and came back when I was okay. But just recently, tbh it's been almost a whole week since I've been feeling depressed, missing him. 

It's normal to just be like, whatever he was stupid. He was probably a catfish. But the issue is the first guy I dated was emotionally abusive and manipulative. So 3 years later when this new guy came into my life, even when we had arguments he would end it by saying ""I love you, ok?"" And I would reply, ""I love you too"". There wasn't a time where he made me feel small or weak and he never cursed me out. He treated me like how a good bf is suppose to treat their gf... ig? 

I forgot to mention.. (I'm going to get so much hate for this and will surely be called stupid.. ik ik I was stupid) He only ever sent me one photo of himself, and it's blurry [If you want to see it, ask admin]

In short I was told that Person A has told a few people that Person B told them that I harassed them.  Let me first clarify that I didn’t.  

Starting with B, I think I suspect who it might be if A isn’t lying which I’ll get to later.  But what horrifies me is that they’re not the type of person to do this?  Why do I suspect her then?  Because I’ve actually communicated with her and therefore she’s probably the only person I could have potentially harassed.  But the thing is it’s not as if I try to talk to B a lot and can’t take any hints.  It’s more like I kinda talk to them from time to time then this shit comes out of nowhere and it could only have come from them.

Frankly, I don’t like to think B could do this assuming it is them.  That’s why I think it’s much more likely that A made this shit up.  This isn’t unlikely since A is quite a despicable person from what I’ve seen.  Why would they do this?  As far as I know, B is a control freak and doesn’t want me interacting with their social circle so they told all of them I harassed A in order to exclude me.  It’s not a big deal since I wasn’t exactly friends with any of these people but it bothers me that B could say such things about me and that there are people who apparently believe them, since I’ve been effectively excluded.

As for the social circle I guess they have no reason to believe me over A but it also bothers me that they don’t care to fact check either although maybe they had an B is the liar.

I really want to say these in class today but didn’t get a chance, since the “debate” was going so crazy between a few individuals.  Honestly this is not the most interesting class out there, and the instructor is not the best lecturer either. But some of you in that class gotta stop disrupting the instructor, just let he teach please🙄🙄 For example, today the lecturer was talking about something about heuristics and used a depression questionnaire as an example. First question on the questionnaire was something like, “did you cry in the last week” or something, if you answered no, according to the questionnaire you do not have clinical depression. Like hey, the instructor was just using it as an example, it’s a class of making judgements and decisions, it’s not Psyc100. I agree that maybe the instructor could use a better an example, but there was definitely no need to argue with the instructor for 10+ or even 20 minutes (a 50 minute class) on how this questionnaire is wrong and not reliable and will not be a good questionnaire.  Especially the girl sitting at the front row, who claimed that she has clinical depression, and that this specific questionnaire will not properly diagnose her situation. Like hey I’m sorry for what you going through, and I want to say that everything will be better, but like hey, we should just let the instructor teach. It’s great that you are sharing your opinions, but frankly speaking not all your opinions are important nor valid. Stop arguing with the instructor on little details that don’t matter to the topic.

13861,2019-05-17 22:41:20,"I don't believe Alvin Kang is innocent. 

Anybody who has taken Chinese with Cha Laoshi knows how kind and gentle-hearted he is. When I took his class in 2018, he caught people cheating but let them off with a stern warning (for cheating on hw tho). Samuel Cha has a sterling reputation at UCSD, and he isn't one to accuse a student of cheating and report them to AIO without substantial reason/evidence. 

Also, Alvin's explanation of what happened in confessions 3.0 was super unclear and sounds like he's deliberately leaving incriminating information out. It's 2019, anybody can spoof a Google maps location (people did it all the time to cheat on Pokemon go). No professor just randomly decides to accuse you of cheating without evidence. Interesting how Alvin doesn't mention any of the evidence against him, and I'm sure he has no interest in doing so either. If you've ever taken a class with Samuel Cha, you would agree with me that something about Alvin's story doesn't add up. 

Don't get me wrong, it's totally possible that Alvin is innocent. But until he's willing to share with us ALL the facts of his case CLEARLY, y'all shouldn't donate a cent to his GoFundMe.

I’m all about women empowerment don’t get me wrong. But I don’t feel comfortable with my boyfriend liking those kind of photos. He told me he’d unfollow the accounts and he slowly has been but I still see what he likes and it’s still the same content. I’m not sure what to do. It’s been making me feel insecure lately. Obviously the best answer is to talk to him again but I hate repeating myself more than once when it comes to expressing concerns and problems. I feel like he should take into consideration with how I feel cause I’m sure he wouldn’t like if I started to follow a bunch of men and half my feed is shirtless men with six packs and a ripped body. Should I just brush it off or wait till I see him again and ask him in person if he unfollowed those accounts? I don’t want to hear “if you’re not insecure it shouldn’t bother” type of bs - it’s uncomfortable to see your partners feed be mostly women who are naked or barely clothed majority of the time. ,,"advice, dating, overthinking",,Thu,44.800000000000026,33.67000000000006,52.5,0.128,0.773,0.099,-0.6633,01

I've spent some years trying to improve my attitude towards women and respect them. But recently I did something messed up, and now it seems like all of my effort was a waste, and that no matter how much work I put in I still fall back to the same harmful thoughts.

I think this goes deeper than society conditioning me to think like this (if that's plausible or a thing), but my behavior towards women seems to be the most troubling atm.

“Full time” officially means 35 hours, but men work more hours than women. That’s the first problem: We could be comparing men working 40 hours to women working 35.

Not only that men work longer, but we also have different jobs which do result in the gap. With education and new opportunities women do take on the jobs that were initially ""men"" jobs, such as investment banking, military, politicians.

I kindly ask, from the people that roll their eyes when they hear your voice after he points to a student because we know that this is going to take a while: Could you not disrupt class by doing it every. single. class. period? 

When the professor stops actually answering your question and says ""I don't know what your point is"" after you've spent more time than it takes for me to go to the bathroom and get back trying to say something, its probably a sign that you've been talking for too long.

13486,2019-05-09 00:15:21,"What really bothers me is how people are simply killing animals all the time. Like why? I find it so stupid how people go out killing animals when there's an animal attack. For example, we see a shark attack and then the next few years, we start going out there and hunting sharks. Sharks don't even attack humans on purpose. First of all, you're in their fucking territory and they have the right to defend themselves and home. Don't fucking expect the animals to not defend their homes when you're fucking in their territory. We fucking have the right to shoot people for being in our property like the fucking wild animals that we are but when an animal is doing the same exact thing, it's fucking like the world is going to end. Second of all, most animals are fucking curious so they ""nibble"" and sometimes it just so fucking happens that it's labelled as an ""attack"". Dogs fucking come up and sniff for curiosity or they fucking teeth and we think it's cute. Sorry sharks don't fucking come up to you and poke you with their fins as curiosity. Their way of being curious is having a nibble; they're just strong jaws. That's why people in fucking cages when shark diving get ""attacked"". Sharks don't know what the fuck is that thing doing in the water and they want to know. We are allowed to just waltz into any fucking animal territory and study their homes and behavior how ever we like because of curiosity without thinking about invading their territory. There's fucking 16 annual shark attacks and 1 fatal shark attack EVERY. TWO. FUCKING. YEARS. You have a higher chance of dying to a fucking bullet ant than a shark. What's with people killing animals and poaching?!?!? Who in the right fucking mind looks into an animals eyes and fucking start cutting their horns off? That's like having other fucking people coming up to you and taking your fucking organs and selling it for money, which is the fucking black market organ trade. That's so fucking wrong but you're doing the same exact shit to animals but because we're on the top of the food chain or we are a more advanced organism living in this fucking world, it gives us the right to fucking do that to other animals but when it's done to us, it's fucking war. Don't fucking get mad at me and say shit like ""there's people out there who do good for these animals"". Yea no shit, there's people out there but there's also fucking good cops our there but all we fucking remember is those police officers who shoot black people just because they can. It's because we're wearing a uniform that represent the human race and there's fucking a lot of people who are out there making these adorable and loving animals go extinct. This is why I wish there's more diseases like cancer and the bubonic plague to fucking kill more humans; we're over populating this fucking world anyway and killing other animals just to sustain our selfish asses. Yea, say what if my family members get cancer? Honestly, that's just how life goes and it sucks. I'm willing to exchange 2.53 billion people for all the animals that aren't SUPPOSED to go extinct and have them back. It fucking sucks thinking how there's only 2 FUCKING NORTHERN WHITE RHINOS LEFT. It fucking sucks how some of us will never know how a fucking gorilla, tigers, sea turtles, orangutans, elephants, rhinos, or even saolas look like because we're too busy fucking killing other animals to keep ourselves alive. Don't give me crap about this is just survival of the fittest. These animals belong here and they are the reason why we have life on this shitty planet. I'm tired of seeing people treating other living things like shit. I'm tired of seeing people not know what belongs in the fucking trash or recycle or compost. I'm tired of dumb-ass people who are fucking in college and still don't know how to act as a fucking decent human being. People like that are a fucking waste of space and deserve to die.

unposted,2019-05-08 14:39:27,"#13268 I’m embarrassed as fuck that you’re the voice that’s chosen to represent Zionism on this page. If you don’t feel confident in your political views, don’t admit that when you call out someone else for theirs, especially anonymously.

Support for Israel in the United States should not be a monolith, the current Knesset government is ripe for criticism. However, this does not mean that all criticism of Israel is fair, or even truthful. From one liberal to many, here are the checks you can go through yourself to determine whether or not you’re an antisemite when you criticize Israel.

1. Am I demonizing Israel in the same way Jews are demonized by open anti-semites?
Example: instead of “The state of Israel kills Palestinian babies! They’re evil!” say “when the IDF responds with lethal force to rocks and firebombs being thrown at them in Gaza’s protests, children are often among the dead. I condemn Israel’s military for their actions but why do Palestinian protesters feel the need to bring their children to what they know will be a lethal backlash?” (Answer: Hamas pays its martyrs)

2. Am I delegitimizing Israel’s right to exist, even though self-determination is the same bedrock argument for Palestinian statehood?
Example: instead of “Israel illegally stole land given to Palestine in the UN partition plan of 1947”, say, “While Palestinian leadership at the time walked away from the 1947 plan, it is long overdue for Palestinians to be given autonomous control over the West Bank and Gaza” (as long as said control isn’t government by terrorist organization but that’s my opinion showing again)

3. Am I applying a double standard to Israel that doesn’t apply to other countries?
Example: Calling for political and systemic violence against Israel for civilian casualties during war when only 2% of the casualties from President Obama’s drone strikes in Pakistan were known military leaders, and had over a thousand civilian injuries.

The Israel-Palestine conflict is one of the most difficult political topics to navigate. Both sides commit routine acts of murder because the other side won’t stop, and excessive, unchecked, improper criticism of both sides can lead to anti-semitism and islamophobia.

He literally bought sodium nitrite online because it's a ""quick and painless"" way to die (I've read that it's definitely neither of those), and he's waiting on it to arrive. He wasnt planning on using it immediately, just keeping it as sort of a peace of mind, but he's telling me now that he doesn't think he'll make it to the end of the week. I've been begging him to get help for a while, and he's calling CAPS tomorrow, but he's planning on withholding enough information to prevent him from getting institutionalized. I know that being in a psych ward doesn't really do anything but physically prevent you from hurting yourself, that he'd still be suicidal when he leaves, and that he'd rather die than go back to a psych ward, but he needs serious help ASAP. He has the philosophy that when someone wants to commit, they should be allowed to do so, but he hasn't really tried any treatments. He's passionate and incredibly talented in what he does, he's done really important work with some of the comp sci professors on campus, has internships lined up for summer, and is almost guaranteed to get into grad school here because of the profs he's worked with (he wants a phD). 
This bout of depression was all triggered by a breakup. He's definitely had issues before, but right now it's a response to his ex. I don't want to disrespect his ideology on suicide or anything, and I don't want to put him in a psych ward (they really fucking suck), but he needs it. I'm positive that he'll kill himself if he doesn't get sent to one. He has so much passion and drive in him, but he's got years of unaddressed mental health issues and alcoholism he's never addressed.
I know he'd be pissed if I told anyone, but I'm pretty sure I'm gonna have to alert campus police or something. God, I don't know where to begin.

I was so shocked that I dropped my hot fucking pocket on the ground and he immediately said “uhhh he borrowed my charger and I just came to get it” and I was like “oooh ok so where is the charger??” And obviously there was no charger so he confessed that it’s been going on for a while now and basically asked me to keep it a secret.

I tried to end it after a month but it dragged on to over 6 fucking months because every time I tried to cut ties with him, he would either call the police and tell them I was suicidal or cut himself and claim he was depressed. It irks me so much because I've struggled with anxiety and depression for years, and whenever I broke up with him he'd pull the ""depression"" card to manipulate me into giving him attention despite never having a history of mental illness. I finally ended things after he anally raped me, after which he would post all these sadboy instagram stories about how he is now depressed and told everyone that I left him for another guy. I did find a great person and am in an amazing relationship with now, but that was 6 months after I tried to get away from his toxic ass. 

His sister went out of her way to dm me and attacked me for leaving her poor sweet little brother, who ""loved"" me so much, for another guy. Allegedly, I would also ""threaten to kill myself over him"" and he was better off without me. Honestly, its no surprise that he would whine and mope about the breakup to paint himself as a victim, but its infuriating for my mental health issues to be misappropriated in order to set me up as some crazy ex girlfriend, and its downright painful to be accused of these things when this guy is literally my abuser and my rapist. 

The worst part is that one of his best friends, who is a UCSD student, saw the abuse and actually helped me end the relationship -- yet he still hangs out with him and invites him to campus to smoke and skate. I always see him on social hanging out here and it just terrifies me that I might one day have to see him again.

Consent has to be freely given without intimidation or fear. Consent has to be clear e.g. verbally saying yes. Consent can be withdrawn at any time, despite past sexual interactions.

I won't get into the details but it was definitely sexual assault. Unconsensual sex. Maybe rape but I don't want to call it that for several reasons: I'm uncomfortable using that word, and my story ""isn't even that bad."" 
I wasn't hit, drugged or anything like that. In fact I was just starting to get to know him the few days before and he seemed really nice. That's the worst part though, and it doesn't make my experience any less valid. He is an otherwise ""nice guy"" and that's what he kept saying in order to convince me that he couldn't have possibly done it. 
You did do it, you vapid fucking bitch boy. You might be nice to your friends but when it came to me you treated me with with pure impulse and manipulation.
It makes me so mad when people doubt SA victims. ""Why didn't you report it happened?"" ""Oh there's no way [assaulter] could've done that, they're nice/shy/respected/etc."" I would be doubted too.
I didn't report it as soon as I could. I reaaallly wanted to rush to CVS to grab what I needed and get home ASAP so I could clean myself instead.

    Let me tell you all one brutal truth. The person you call boyfriend isn't any different. It's just dumb fucking luck. He got the opportunity to know you more. At the end of the day he invested all those hours just to get you.

I become consumed by rage to the point where I can’t believe what someone tells me, regardless of whether I know it to be true or not. I’ve contemplated suicide more times in my life than I can count. When I was around 14, I was actually going to do it, but someone sent an anonymous tip to the police. I was almost forcibly hospitalized, but I was able to avoid that by agreeing to therapy. Therapy has been a mixed bag for me. My first one blamed me for my parents marital issues and overall just berated me (it was group therapy). My second one was a lot better, but I stopped feeling better as sessions continued. She also didn’t believe that I had depression, but thought I fit the description for adjustment disorder. I look at myself and don’t know who I am anymore. When my emotions consume me, I’m unable to think clearly and I isolate myself from all of my friends. I overreact and push them away, knowing full well what I’m doing but not being able to do anything. I also begin to disassociate, and feel like I’m not the person inside my own body. It feels like I’m another person watching all of this happen before my eyes. At times, I don’t feel any emotion at all, just an absolute emptiness. I feel so fucking helpless. I’ve definitely gotten worse after coming to college. I’ve started hearing voices in my head.

For me Cinco de Mayo is truly a day to celebrate. Few people have come to know the “true” story of the origin of Cinco de Mayo. It is my pleasure to set the record straight.

A little known fact is that back in 1912, Hellmann’s mayonnaise was manufactured in England. In fact, the Titanic was carrying 12,000 jars of the condiment scheduled for delivery in Vera Cruz, Mexico, which was to be the next port of call for the great ship after its stop in New York. This would have been the largest single shipment of mayonnaise ever delivered to Mexico but as we know, the great ship did not make it to New York.

The ship hit an iceberg and sank and the cargo was forever lost. The people of Mexico, who were crazy about mayonnaise and were eagerly awaiting its delivery, were disconsolate at the loss. Their anguish was so great, that they declared a National Day of Mourning which they still observe to this day. The National Day of Mourning occurs each year on May 5th and is known, of course as Sinko de Mayo.",,trigger warning,,Sat,11.834000000000016,34.28200000000002,14.640000000000011,0.125,0.76,0.115,-0.5106,11

My anxiety has been getting so much worse and not until this quarter that I said no more I can’t keep living like this. So I seemed help from CAPS. I’ve been dealing with it for a very long time but never went to a psychiatrist or psychologist. Just a high school counselor who was of no help to me. 

Having to deal with anxiety is such a horrible thing. I’ve dealt with it since I was 12. And I’m surprised I’ve made it this far because dealing with suicidal thoughts was also another thing that pops in with anxiety. People say “just do something to get your mind off of it” well I played a sport most of my life, played a musical instrument, was part of ASB, was part of the top 10% of my class...well nothing worked. So it’s not as easy to ignore it. I could be having the best time and then out of no where I lose it....

To those that don’t know what people with anxiety go thru...where here’s what happens to me atleast....I constantly wonder if I even need to keep on with college because I doubt I’ll make it to my PhD (but that’s just my anxiety talking), I always tend to say sorry even when it’s not my fault because it feels like everything is my fault. Some times I feel like everything is a dream and I’m just watching everything and everyone go thru with life behind a window. When I get anxiety attacks...I start feeling out of place as if no one wants me around which causing me to want to be alone so I go to my room or somewhere alone...then the shaking starts..an uncontrollable shaking.. then i can even feel the blood going thru my veins as I start hyperventilating. I swear I try to breathe but nothing works it feels like there’s no oxygen for me to breathe in....then at that point where I’m just sitting in the corner feeling horrible it gets worse...I start hearing (remembering) things that people would tell me. Whenever a mean coach would yell and tell me I sucked well that would come to mind...whenever my mom would yell at me call me stupid and that I won’t make it well that would come to mind...Everything. You just hear everything and it just all attacks you at once. Then you get a feeling inside you that you want to scream so loud but you can’t because you don’t want anyone else to hear. It’s all this until all you can do is lay on the ground and cry. Cry so much your head and eyes hurt.....And that everyone...is anxiety.

Sure they pay a lot more but at what cost? Their dishonest work discredits ours, degrades of degrees and hinders our quality of education. Most international student's don't even stay in the U.S after graduation to work and stimulate our economy. Most go back to China, Korea, India, Saudi Arabia--flaunt their U.S degrees, work in their home country, stimulate their economies, all the while us Americans take the hit.

- give it an epic dual-typing like Grass/Steel.  Yeah this make it 4x weak to fire but honestly almost anything with Grass makes it 4x weak to something (rock is good but honestly is lame)
- give it leech seed levelling up

Fire starter
- make it a quadraped mammal cuz nobody wants creativity they want more arcanines
- make it part normal cuz everyone hates fire/fighting cuz hurdur too many
- make a bipedal first form so when the design is initially released people will think it’s gonna be fire/fighting based on the tiniest detail
- make it blatantly not part of the chinese zodiac because people haven’t figured out that fennekin, a fox, is not a fucking dog and they still think this is a fucking thing

It was 100% my fault and I was ready to exchange my insurance info and whatnot. Stuff got weird when he gave me the option to pay him $200 cash or make a police/insurance report. I had no cash on me and so I told him I’d rather do an insurance claim. He started getting really pushy about me “giving him a number” (cash) so that I wouldn’t have to make an insurance claim. It kinda felt like extortion. I should note that he was an older Asian man which makes it weird since he finally left me alone after he asked me simply “are you a student? Do you you speak Spanish?” To which I answered yes and he was like NVM FORGET ABOUT IT and left. I still made a police report afterwards just in case it was reported as a hit and run but a lot of people told me it might’ve been a scam.

fast forward to the same shift. at work sometimes the pro staff there get to do workshops/presentations for students. at the end people who went get to do a review on the speaker. one student in their review went OFF on how “unprofessional” and “unengaged” my boss was during an activity. when i saw that scathing review and thought back to what my boss told me literally hours before, i wanted to laugh so hard. my boss is such a fucking hypocrite and all the criticism they gave me earlier that shift is so questionable now",,,,Mon,8.189999999999996,37.67399999999997,14.301000000000013,0.114,0.848,0.038,-0.9124,02
12454,2019-04-29 02:17:41,"I had put on this “passionate student leader” facade in front of my coworkers (all of whom actually work for the school and aren’t students) for nearly 3 years now at my on campus job that is related to student leadership. But in reality I just do not give a fuck about student leadership and professionalism the staff there always preaches. I see the entirety of the professional staff there as people who did not figure out what they wanted to do after college, so they decided to just work for university instead claiming a career in “Student Advising” or “Student Leadership” or some BS. I doubt any sane person ever went to undergrad and thought to themselves “I wish I had a major or career path that will literally never let me leave college ever again!”

I gotten to the point where I break so many rules and lie to all the staff all the time because the work is a load of crap and there’s literally no reason why not to break the rules if it means making my job easier (I also do it in spite of how dumb the rules are). I’m so numb to how much it’s actually affecting my job there, but I could care less because my coworkers also do not genuinely care about the students they serve half of the time anyways, despite it being in their job descriptions. The departments like mine claim to “enhance the student experience” when half of the time you are degraded and treated like shit BECAUSE you are a dumb student.

It wasn’t always like this for me. I am a VP of a mid sized social/fun org and it’s so liberating to be grassroots and just put on events and build a small community. No managers that are breathing down your neck. No dumb policies to abide to. No working with people who don’t care. Just working with other students to bring a fun event. That’s the student leadership I live for and is why I initially thought this job I applied for would feel like. But when I have to do similar stuff for work, there’s no passion or emotion behind the projects and events my department puts on. Because it’s run by staff who need to fill an arbitrary quota and enforce stupid policies during the planning and executions of the event. And no matter how good or bad it goes they get a paycheck anyways.

Yes, that was a shitty move on my part.

And uh.. long story short Girlfriend #1 blocked me on everything and never talked to me again, which really I don't blame her for.

Skipping past all the emotional guilt/unhealthy coping mechanisms that persisted through 6 months of my next relationship, I still feel incredibly guilty. Looking back too, she tried to reach out to me multiple times after the breakup so we could connect and catch up, but I was always busy with school, and.. I just regret everything?

It's two years down the line, and I'm still finding myself dwelling on something that happened way in past, when I've already made my peace, and I don't really understand?

I just think back to how utterly shitty I made her feel, and how I completely cut off a wonderful person from my life forever because I was a dumbass who couldn't control his dick. We made plans before she left to meet up again, and how we were even going to be at eachothers' weddings, and I just ruined everything. Jesus man, that shit comes back to me at night sometimes and it really just fucks me up.

Is it ever really supposed to go away?

I've spent alot of time making my peace with it so I could fully love Girlfriend #2, and I thought I did, but after Breakup #2, that shit just pops out on quiet nights (during Joji too actually), and I don't really know what to do with myself?

I'm not simping after my ex, I just feel like an incredibly shitty person because of what I've done, and of an important person that I've lost.

I do believe sometimes you can't speak the truth to be considerate of the person, which depends on the environment and the concept which gets complicated. I just mean straight up lying about something here). My boyfriend, despite knowing how much I value the truth, has lied to me about something over the course of our entire relationship and only told me now after we've been dating for about 6 or 7 months. Almost a year since we've met. I did not know what to do when he told me and it was through text, the night before my midterm when I was studying. Because of this I ended up pulling an all-nighter trying to study while the shock was in my mind and ended up passing out at a commuter lounge. Besides all that, I made an exception and gave my boyfriend a second chance because I really love him. Now here's where things gets a little complicated. Since then, I've unintentionally started to emotionally abuse my boyfriend (i realized this, and he knows it too). By unintentionally, I stopped sharing things as much and did alot of things that were described on articles describing an emotionally abuse relationship and later realized that these are actually a part of an abusive relationship. Despite knowing that, my boyfriend decides to stay with me because he told me that he loves me. A part of me hated doing this because I know it is morally wrong, but the other part of me feels like  he deserved at least some of it because he knew how lying impacts me and how much I values the truth, but decides to lie anyways. I have multiple evidence of he telling me that he's never lied to me and never will, just to later on find out that he was lying making these lies as well. During the course of the ""emotional abuse"", he blames himself that this happened because he lied to me. Right now we've gotten to an agreement that we'll work through this together, but I'm honestly lost. I don't know where to begin because my mind is telling me that he's lied to me and I'm too insecure to put trust into him again, but I really love him and I want to do it.

I'm following suit, because that, to me, is also a little pretentious to talk about. Like, if you're gonna showcase your language skills, do it when required.

Coming to UCSD, I’m only beginning to realize the depth of change that our past inflicts on us.

Have you ever met someone with major, obvious personality flaws and wonred how they got there? What kind of trauma or bullying did they go through? Why is their mindset so negative or angry, etc? Then there are people who just seem devoid of a personality altogether. Then there are people who are pathological liars, or repeated cheaters, or abusers of drugs and alcohol. Then there are people who just seem so put together and well-rounded, you can’t help but wonder what on earth they did to actually be a well functioning member of society. Since college is essentially the “bridge” between childhood and adulthood, it’s interesting to see how some people so clearly have “already grown up” and others might never reach it (though this is a spectrum, not two classifications).

Not saying that you should psychoanalyze everyone to try to figure out where their childhood trauma comes from, but it is an interesting thought.

12347,2019-04-26 19:37:02,"With just days to go before my supply of jerky and nuts from home finally runs out, I recently went out on a hunt with my trusty rifle at my side and came across this most majestic goose. Had a bit of a gander and found that she was leading all of her little goslings around in a nearby lake. I suppose that indicated that she was the mother goose. However, I couldn’t bring myself to raise my rifle to secure sustenance for the next couple of days. It’s not because of all the goslings surrounding her. Truth of the matter is that, one day, we all have to leave our mothers and brothers and sisters to lead our own lives and worlds. Also, I need grub and ain’t gonna starve to death when there’s a source of fresh protein right there in front of me. But rather, it’s because I am afraid that I’ll miss and all it will quite literally turn into a wild goose chase. 

You see, I’ve never been a very good hunter or marksman. Never had anything to show for these hunts. Always aimed a bit too high or got a bit too close. I know a number of people who are excellent hunters and marksmen, who come back with sacks full of their kills. On the flip side, there are people like the British hunter I befriended, a man as calm and refined as Zaroff yet nowhere near as successful or murderous, as well as another gentleman from the former Raj whom I also befriended, another unsuccessful big game hunter who also hasn’t been particularly successful. We all give each other hunting tips despite being equally unsuccessful in the field. Don’t know how useful the tips we give each other are, but by God, the camaraderie we have between us almost makes all the pain from bad hunts worth it, and I thank the Lord everyday I have them in my life. I pray to our heavenly Father that one day, they will all get their big break and finally have something to show for their efforts.

So here I am, sitting in the cold dampness of my hunting lodge. Haven’t a fire going, haven’t found a need to get a fire going. No goose, no need for fire. But man, I am running out of food. If I don’t go out there again and at least try to get that goose before she and her goslings go away, then my goose will really be cooked (haha, the irony). Then I’ll be left wondering if my situation could have ended up different and better, if starvation and failure was the only option, if I would have been successful. Well, I suppose I ought to quit acting like a silly goose myself. No more anxiety. No more delays. It’s time to shoot my shot.

I graduated and am currently in the process of getting a job in EE. I’m not saying not going to college is the better option. Of course I wouldn’t be getting these interviews without my degree. Of course college opens up a lot of opportunities. 

But I don’t think college really made that much of a difference. Everything that I learned for this career could’ve been learned in a few months. Definitely under a year, let alone 4+. 

There’s so much fluff in college. 2 years of essentially learning garbage that you went over in high school. Things that you’ll never use or care about. And we fucking pay for it! Five thousand fucking dollars per quarter to go through this useless bullshit

And then upper division. Professors don’t care about the students. 90% of them anyway. They’re here for research, not to teach. Students end up learning mostly from textbooks or on their own. Then what the fuck is the point of taking a class of I’m Learning most of the content on my own?

I understand this will vary depending on the major. But it applies to me and many of my peers. 

I’ve worked at internships before, alongside people making a very good amount of money. Many of them are in the six figure range that doesn’t start with a 1. None of them get as bombarded with work as my peers do. Academia can get extremely hard and stressful and I don’t think it’s reasonable. It doesn’t reflect a real work environment. 

Again, I understand I’m basing this off my experience and that it will vary. But I would honestly be surprised if a large amount of work environments reflect the stress that students go through. 

Overall, college is an extremely inefficient way of preparing people for a career. There are absolutely better ways to do it. ",[redacted],rant,,Fri,60.276999999999894,29.539000000000062,43.926999999999914,0.103,0.815,0.081,-0.8245,12

The people who say shit just because ""oooohhh, somebody got offended lol"", what's wrong with you? Why are you intentionally trying to hurt someone? It's so unnecessary. I get that there's something funny about provoking someone with a stick up their ass, but come on, a lot of you go way to far, and can do some serious hurt. There are certain hard lines that you do not cross, and you need to learn about those lines. I like to think those hard boundaries are common sense, but apparently not, so I recommend you ask around. No shame in not knowing, but there's a world of shame in not willing to learn.

And on the other side, the PC police, y'all are some serious cry-bullies. You start complaining about how everything is offensive and hurtful, but guess what? You're hurting people, too, as much as you'd like to deny it. Oh, and when it comes down to the people you're claiming to ""stand up for"", let's face it, you don't care about us. You don't care about what we go through. You just brush your ego by being a self-righteous SJW-type. 

General solution: rather than concerning yourself with what is and isn't PC, just try not to be a jerk. It costs nothing to be nice to someone.

Because now I understand I don't actually want to die. Processing these feelings into things that are less defeating and all-encompassing makes my emotions more tangible. For the better, I stop spiraling into a depressive hole of wanting to die as my only solution. 

""I don't want to experience stress"", ""I wish I didn't read that"", ""I wish I understood this problem"", I can process properly. I can live, and live with these emotions. They're still sad emotions, but I can cry to myself saying these phrases instead of ""I want to die"" over and over.

unposted,2019-04-25 18:12:32,"First Scene is actually Hawkeye losing his family to the snap. He doesn’t actually see it happen as he is facing the other direction. We then get the Tony/Nebula sequence (paper football, etc). Tony records his message to Pepper. When he falls asleep, Nebula takes him to the front of the ship and sits him in the pilots seat. He wakes up and sees something glowing outside the window. Captain Marvel helps them return to Earth. Pepper, Rocket, Steve and Rhodey all come out to greet him. Tony is very shaken, particularly about losing Peter.

Movie starts with the Avengers trying to find Thanos. Steve wasn’t to know where Thanos is and asks Tony, but Tony says he doesn’t know, They argue. Nebula knows of Thanos’ garden he said he would once go to when he completed his goal. They found him because of the energy he released using the gauntlet. Thanos is alone, and tells them he used the gauntlet to destroy the gems. He is weak and Thor, angry, decapitates him.

Title Card and five years later.

Natasha is now basically in charge of what's left of the Avengers is talking to them via holograms. Basically the world is in ruins and they're trying to salvage it. Carol is there via hologram with a new haircut and uniform and tells them that she's covering thousands of planets and won't be able to come back to Earth for a ""long time"".

Steve and Nat talk about how the Avengers are family. Inside a storage shed is Luis’s van. A rat is crawling over the Quantum controls and activated the switch which brings Scott out. He’s now locked inside the cage but starts waving at the security cameras. A guard lets him out and he is walking the streets confused as to why everything is so overgrown and run down. He finds a memorial which lists the names of the ‘missing’ on large stones. He starts reading them panicking that Cassie might be listed on them. But she isn’t. He sees her at home, as an older version of herself. Scott drives to the Avengers facility and Nat and Steve let him in and he tells them about the Quantum realm and how they might be able to build a time machine to go back to the past before everything happened. They visit Tony, but he doesn’t want to help. He’s happy with the way that his life is, with Pepper and his daughter Morgan. They leave and to visit Bruce who is now Professor Hulk.

The plan becomes to start looking for the gems in the past. Initially Banner builds quantum time machine and sends Scott back to test but it is faulty, Tony refuses to help at this point, however, he returns Caps shield and they make up. He tweaks Banners Quantum Machine, The catch is that they need quantum particles for it to work.

Natasha goes to Japan to get Clint. He is mourning his family and is not certain of the plan. Rocket and Hulk go to get Thor who is drinking and playing video games with Korg and Meik. (Funny joke involving an online video game troll)

Finally the team then all suit up and discuss their plans to get the stones. They make it clear that they can not mess up because there is only enough Quantum particles for one trip for each of them.



Tony, Scott, Steve and Bruce go to the Battle of New York. Hulk meets the Ancient One at Dr Stranger's future home. Ancient One refuses to give the Time Stone to Bruce but relents when Bruce tells her that Dr Strange will give the stone to Thanos.

Cap, Iron Man and Scott tries to retrieve the Tessaract after Loki surrenders. SHIELD/Hydra agents Crossbones and that bald guy with glasses in Winter Soldier retrieve the brief case containing the Tessaract. Past Hulk funnily has to walk down lots of flights of stairs as he can't go on lift due to maximum capacity. Cap meets with Crossbones with the briefcase in elevator along with other Hydra agents. He convinces them to give him the briefcase containing the staff when he utters two words: Hail Hydra. Cap gets the briefcase. Tony in disguise as a SWAT soldier tells Scott to disable his past self's chest reactor to give him a minor seizure while his past self meets up with Alexander Pierce who demands the Mind Stone and Loki. Present Tony retrieves the briefcase but past Hulk accidentally knocks out Tony and Loki uses the confusion to teleport out with the Tessaract. Present Cap accidentally meets with his 2012 self, and 2012 self thinks he's Loki in disguise. They fought and 2012 has present self in chokehold when he tells his past self that Bucky is alive. He then taps his past self with staff to knock him out.

In Asgard, fat Thor and Rocket plans to retrieve the Aether out of Jane Foster's body. Thor's mother meets his 'son' and know he's from the future. Rocket retrieves the aether out of Jane by prodding her off screen and gets chased by guards. Before Thor leaves, he retrieves Mjolnir!

On Morag, War Machine and Nebula stays on Morag while Clint and Nat goes to Voromir via a ship that Rocket miniatures for Clint. Unknown to Nebula, her past self's nervous system and databanks are connected to each other and Thanos finds out where the stones are and how he meets his fate.

Cap and Tony transport back to 1970 at the SHIELD training site seen in Winter Soldier and goes underground to retrieve that era's Tessaract. Tony retrieves the Tesseract while meeting his dad. He calls himself Howard Potts. Cap makes a prank call to young Hank Pym and sneaks into his office to steal 4 vials of Pym Particles. Cap also sees Peggy. Cap and Tony teleport back to present.

WM and Nebula knocks out Quill during his dance in intro of GOTG. They got the stone and WM and Nebula was meant to teleport together but WM only succeeded. Present Nebula and past Nebula meets and fights and past Nebula takes her place to go back to present.

On Voromir, Clint and May meets the Red Skull as seen in Infinity War and is told how to retrieve the stone. Clint and Nat fought each other. Clint jumped off cliff but Nat catches him and held on by grappling rope. She falls off and dies like Gamora. Clint now has the Stone.

All members went back to present and everyone is devastated by Nat's death. Tony and Bruce constructs the Infinity Gauntlet and Thor wants to wield it but Hulk goes instead as he's the strongest one and the stones emit gamma radiation according to him. He wields it and snaps his fingers restoring all life lost. Clint's wife calls him on mobile. Hulk suffers extreme pain in his right arm due to IG. Past Nebula activates the Quantum teleporter and summons Thanos' warship and blasts the Avengers HQ to ruins with missiles.

Hulk lifting up rubble similar to Secret Wars cover where he lifts up a whole mountain except this is less in film lol.

Clint finds the gauntlet and is being chased by Outriders creatures in last film. He kills them and is met by past Nebula. Gamora and present Nebula meets up and Nebula kills her past self.

Cap, Tony and Thor teams up against Thanos. Thor is losing against Thanos even though he has Stormbreaker and Mjolnir. Thanos is about to kill Thor with SB when:

Cap lifts up Mjolnir and beats Thanos with hammer and shield.

Thanos uses his double blade weapon to break Cap's shield in half.

Thanos summons his whole army including the Black Order and some new creatures. Cap is all by himself against a whole army.

He hears Sam's voice and he turns around and see EVERYONE who has vanished PLUS huge armies of Wakandans, sorcerers and Asgardians (no signs of Warrior Three). Wong, Valkyrie, Wasp and Pepper Potts as Rescue turns up as well. Ant Man becomes Giant Man.

Clint plays American Football with IG and passes it to Black Panther then Spidey. Quill meets past Gamora and gets hit in the balls, not believing he is the one she loves lol. Scarlet Witch overpowers Thanos but Thanos orders missiles to hit everyone including his forces. Captain Marvel shows up to destroy Thanos' flagship and gets the IG and dashes towards the goal. There is a bit where Hope and Scott goes to the van with the Quantum teleporter in the middle of battlefield. Was lost in the moment so forgot why they doing that, sorry.

All female Marvel characters fight Thanos. Spidey's armoured suit goes autokill mode with the extra arms.

Thanos tries to take the gauntlet off Marvel by headbutting her but didn't phase her.

Thanos retrieves the gauntlet away from Stark and he snaps his fingers. Nothing happened. The stones went to Stark and before he snaps his fingers, he says 'I'm Iron Man'.

White flash of light.

All of Thanos' forces turn to dust including Thanos himself.

Tony dies from using the gauntlet. Everyone mourns.

The battle is won but at a cost.

Holographic Tony gives a message to everyone present including his daughter.

A wreath with Tony's chest reactor is laid to rest at the lake near Tony's hut.

Everyone is present including GOTG, Peter, Maria, Ross, Nick and Hank and Janet.

Thor, still fat designates Valkyrie as Queen of New Asgard in Tonnsberg. Thor is now travelling with GOTG to find Gamora and maybe more Asgardians. Quill and Thor are about to fight for leadership lol.

Scott, Cassie and Hope are together again. Wakanda is back with his King.

Cap goes on a mission to put back the stones and Mjolnir to their proper places. Hulk says to Sam and Buck that he should be back in 5 secs. He didn't. Sam sees a old man at a bench and it's Old Man Steve (who looks like Clint Eastwood now but less wrinkles and bit younger than he is lol). Steve has wedding ring and passes his shield to Sam. Sam is honoured.

Ending shows young Cap dancing with Peggy at their house. That's it.

Credits music is set to 1930s music then shows all cast members. The main cast is shown with their signatures on it.

There is NO post credit scenes which is a first for a MCU.

Stan Lee cameo is set in 1970s where he is shown in his 70s younger self driving a car with a woman, driving past a army base where Cap and Tony retrieves the Tesseract there.

Fuck, every time someone asks me what I'm doing I always tell them ""I'm doing my portfolio!

It's so funny when guys have to justify their fkboi-ness by passing it off as iMmAtUrItY. just say that you never learned how to be a decent human being, and that your pathetically horny ass would much rather dick around with feelings that aren't yours to make yourself feel better abt how emotionally stunted you are, and GO.

""They're just immature and don't know what they want?"" Hell, a LOT of ppl don't know what they want in life, or from others, but they don't make it their mission statement to toy around with the ppl in their lives, or to use them.

""They could use meaningful friends"" no SHIT, dumbass, we all do. the already flimsy explanation of why fkbois are the way they are by blaming it on how s h i t t y their support system is bollocks. FUCK that noise, it's not our responsiblity to H E A L them or HELP THEM SEE THE LIGHT, the argument that these ppl don't have good friends is stupid as shit. Having a large, impersonal group of friends does not make you a piece of shit LMAOOOOO. trying to find excuses for your destructive behavior and lack of self-awareness DOES.

An actual hot take: guys who have to justify that they're Not Fuckbois.... ARE fuckbois.

Another one: softbois are Also fuckbois, y'all the same species, don't try to distinguish yourselves

Last one: hey *, u kno who u r-- if you're reading this, I am so sorry that you have to wallow in your own self-pity to make yourself feel better abt how you hurt the current person you're seeing. Stop acting like your guilt overpowers your girl's hurt after the bullshit you pulled on her. She doesn't have to comfort YOU on how you hurt HER during the time that YOU have to apologize. Either cuff her and give her what you told her you would, or I will. Step up, dude, you're not fucking special. 

and for the last guy **, you never learned, did you? Your current girlfriend doesn't know what you've been doing behind her back. And you know that, and I hope that eats you from the inside out. I hope it festers so much that all you can spit out is bile and poison and you'll be choking on your own mistakes so hard that no one will be able to hear your pathetic excuses. You had costume jewelry but now that you have sterling silver in your hands you still long for something that's cheap and easy. I feel so sorry for you. You never deserved this much.

However that is why when your depressed ass is talking to itself, you gotta turn that shit upside down and literally tell yourself you believe in yourself multiple times even if it gets repetitive. If you keep on believing in yourself, at least in my experience, you will gain motivation again to do the work your depressed ass had no motivation to do before and procrastinated on. So instead of thinking about that crush, or friend that never messaged you back, or takes forever to respond and doesn't seem to give you back the attention you give them and you're sad about that, drop that shit. Throw your mind into a new path in believing yourself first. You have nothing to prove to others, you just need to prove to yourself first with self confidence in getting shit done.
Sincerely, op from #11440, the crushes ain't shit op, yes they still ain't shit either. Self motivate yourself with positive thoughts and tell your depressed ass you can do it. I know you can.

""Someones got a bad case of triton eye""
Oof. Maybe, but I do think that it's overplayed and that there are genuinely some very attractive girls here.

“Religious reasons”
""It likely means they're ugly and lack the social skills needed to pursue in this case women. Religion in this context is nothing more than a scapegoat for OP's own shortcomings""

Dang. I thought this place was supposed to be nice. This comment is low-key hurtful but I'll address it nonetheless.

I have platonic relationships with both sexes, and have had flirtatious relationships with girls in the past, so no, I don't lack the social skills to talk to women. I'm also not particularly ugly going by what others have said. How exactly is religion a scapegoat for my shortcomings? What exactly are my shortcomings in this case? No, my being abstinent is not because I am ugly or because I cannot talk to females (which I don't think is an actual issue that people have because females are just…people.) Rude and baseless comment though. 

""I dunno OP, you tell us. Why do you choose to stay abstinent? Is it worth it? You know, give us some more deets.""

Very valid question. I believe sex within marriage is the only place where it is acceptable as it is a mirror of Christ being the groom to the bride who is the church. Practically, the reason is that it avoids the pitfalls of hookup culture. I've been told all my life that I should be abstinent because of the aforementioned reasons, but in college, I'm now surrounded by people who constantly have extramarital sex and, well, nothing seems to be going wrong for them. So the predicament I'm in is that I'm questioning why exactly I'm doing this if everyone else isn't and they are fine. That's basically what I'm internally struggling with. I don't know if it's worth it or not. 

""Don't mean to offend, I was also raised Christian. But maybe you should stop believing that god cares about when or who you fuck.""

No offense taken, this is a relatively mild comment. This just gets down to your presuppositions of life and what is moral so I can't really remediate this here. Just different views. I believe He does, you believe he doesn't.

I understand that the Asian community has a long ways to go to work on our anti-blackness (this for real is an issue, especially among older generations, so please @ my fellow asian americans help your parents, grandparents, etc. to understand!!). And I get that some people may perceive that systematic racism does not affect us as much as others, which, in some cases, is true.
But, here's the thing:
""Asian"" is such a diverse term. When you say Asian, do you mean Laotian, Indian, Viet, Filipino, Chinese, etc.? Do you understand the difference in socioeconomic standing between south, southeast, east, and west asians? Why would you lump all of us into one group? Do you know what it's like to have your fellow POC not see you as a POC but for white people to still hold you beneath them because of some stupid model minority myth?
Your perception of the Asian American community is only a fraction of our reality. Many of us have immigrant parents, who fled war or poverty, to come here (my dad left vietnam on a boat by himself when he was only 15). A lot of us have parents who can't speak english, parents who need you to translate things for them when you go out to the market, parents who don't know anything about college, so you have to figure it all out on your own, parents who don't get hired because their english is ""bad"". A lot of southeast asian americans work low income jobs: nail salon techs, supermarket employees, etc. It's demanding, tough work, and people don't respect them, just look at how often people mock nail techs.
What you see about Asian Americans is only what the media portrays, what is barely skimmed over in American history books.
You say you aren't going to deny that Asian Americans have faced discrimination historically, but you only mention dog-eating jokes and the fetish around Asian women, so I hope you also recognize that the historical discrimination of Asians goes beyond that. Chinese Americans were laborers who worked on the railroads in America in terrible conditions. Japanese American citizens were forced into internment camps during WWII bc white people thought they were ""spies"". Vietnamese Americans lived with 3 or more families in a home after fleeing the war. And even today, Asian Americans face discrimination that goes beyond some dog jokes: Southeast Asian gang members from the 70s/80s face deportation threats today: Trump is pushing for the deportation of Vietnamese Americans ""with a criminal record"" who came here before 1995, even if the crime they committed happened when they were teenage gang members in the 70s/80s, and so, so much more.
But this isn't the oppression olympics. We shouldn't fight over who had it worse, but instead, recognize that each POC group has faced and continues to face their own struggle here in America. If we want justice, we have to stick and fight together.
We have to realize the faults we've had to each other and work to improve our communities instead of tearing each other down.

Your post on how Asian Americans only feel discrimination in the form of things like jokes PROVES you have no grasp on history at all and is just dumb in fucking general as you essentially preach fucking more tolerance for African Americans and Latinix people then write a horribly intolerant post. I'm a member of Nikkei Student Union, the Japanese American club on campus, and when I was told many people didn't really know about Japanese internment I didn't believe them but obviously it's true. So here's a little education for you:
Japanese internment camps was a knee jerk reaction of fear and racism. After Pearl Harbor was bombed by the Japanese, many Americans started to have this logic, if you're Japanese you must be a spy. So President Franklin D. Roosevelt himself signed executive order 9066. Where 120,000 Japanese people were sent to concentration camps in the US for two and a half years corcing them to leave their lives and belongings behind. Keep in mind roughly 80,000 of these people were CITIZENS OF THE UNITED STATES and the US betrayed them and said, ""No you guys are second class citizens"". On top of that martial law was enacted in Hawaii to specifically target Japanese who lived there. The FBI went door to door questioning people, and my great grandmother had TO BURN her only picture of her nephew because he was dressed in Japanese military garb because they would think she was a spy. Remember around ww2 pictures weren't that easy of a commodity to come by too.
Anyways even after internment ended things didn't get magically better because when japanese came back all their old belongings were gone and they literally had to start life over. Then you know what they got in return for the civil rights atrocity? Fucking $20,000. Because that somehow makes up for two years of being wrongly imprisoned and losing everyhton you have. Then it seems people like you seem to forget/ignore this horrible atrocity. Which shows another thing about Asian discrimination you completely ignore. We are fucking forgotten. When you hear someone make a racist joke about African Americans, I'm sure you're horrified, but when you hear one about Asian people, I will bet money you laugh your head off.
There is so much you don't understand and this long ass post doesn't even begin to fully cover it.

My roommate and I rarely stay in at home to eat, since we're busy with classes, work, dance practice and clubs, and tend to eat with our friends when we all have time to see each other and hang out. 

When we do have the time to come back and decide to go into the kitchen, it's a mess! The stove top is littered with food spills and random pieces of food under the burners. The counters are almost always dirty too, sometimes with liquids left on the counter, and definitely dirty and used dishes and cooking supplies. The left sink doesn't have the option to dispose of food, but more often than not, there's been food stuffed down the drain. The cabinets above the sink are taken up by a single pot and maybe a box of zip-lock bags, but otherwise aren't housing their dishes and cups, which are always sitting in the dish rack next to the sink at all times until they use them and fill the sink instead.

The dining table is stacked with crumbs, trash and study material; the couches are scattered with more backpacks and even a wax machine, along with wii controllers and candy bags from our college events. There's even trash and even more crumbs on the floor too!

Probably the worst is that when they go shop for groceries, because when they come back, the fridge and freezer is stacked with their food, and leave my roommate and I half a shelf on the door, and less than half of the top rack in the fridge. The freezer is always stuffed to max capacity too. So when my roommate and I go grocery shopping, we have to organize with what little space we were given, if any.

I don't really know which house these kids live in so I can't really approach their parents and the adults are only around sometimes while the kids are playing. Can I file a noise complaint online?

11609,2019-04-20 01:55:04,"MASS SHOOTING - WHAT TO DO

I'm an international student and I want to put this out there because as much as most Americans know what to do in these situations given recent events, many internationals don't because we haven't been exposed to this or taught how to do this. I also don't wanna assume all americans know what to do in one of these events, so this is just a general post to anyone who wants to feel more informed. I've gotten this info from research i've done myself, and most of my sources agree on the same things.

1. AVOID - if you hear something that sounds like gunshots, don't hesitate or wait around for other people to act. Take action and protect yourself - if there is no risk in the way, GET OUT OF THE ZONE AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. Notify others, or take others with you. Always know your exits, wherever you are. LEAVE EVERYTHING. You may want to text your family saying you're ok, but reality is you're not gonna be ok until you're off the shooter's range. Once you're outside and safe, call people - police, 911, family members, friends, etc. Prevent people from entering the area. 

2. DENY - If you can't exit the area, you must find a place you're gonna take shelter and deny the shooter. Eg. if shooter is in the hallway and you're inside a classroom, EVERYONE must act quickly and block the door with as many things as possible- chairs, tables, you can even get creative and use stuff like belts, books, or everyone's backpacks. Do so and then find shelter inside the classroom, stay away from the door as the shooter might start shooting through the door. Turn off all lights, stay away from doors and windows to avoid being seen. Your job here is to make it difficult for the shooter to catch targets. Remain quiet, put your phones in silent mode. You might be hiding but be prepared to fight should the shooter enter the room. 

3. DEFEND - If you are unable to exit or prevent the shooter entry to where you are, this is your last resort. Think of this: he's one shooter with a gun, but you are probably a lecture hall of 100+ students. Be committed to fight back. If one person fights back, the shooter will probably take him down. If 20 people fight back, say by throwing stuff, he stands less of a chance. You can throw furniture, books, tables, laptops, maybe you create a distraction plan while waiting for him to come. Your goal is to disarm and take down the shooter. If you manage to disarm him, DON'T KEEP HOLDING THE GUN. Throw it across the room if you can. Police will come in looking for the person with the gun, you don't wanna be arrested when you in fact disarmed the shooter. The more the people who fight back, the greater the change of survival. Of course 300 people throwing books at one guy could get messy, but everyone can do something, plan something out if you have the time. The shooter is not expecting anyone to fight back, let alone a whole class of students. Use this to your advantage and catch him off guard. Also, be loud and aggressive. Might sound stupid, but it could intimidate the shooter if a class of 100+ people come at him all at once. 

Feel free to add anything else, this is obviously not the only way to survive, and none of these will ensure 100% survival from a shooting, but it increases your chances. Remember, in any emergency situation, the faster you act the higher the chance of surviving you have. Don't hesitate. This could happen at any moment, and I feel everyone should be aware and know what to expect and what to do. If possible don't leave this in the confessions page, share this info around, if something ever happens we might be able to save a lot more lives.

I was very depressed my sophomore year of high school because I felt like I had no friends (hindsight says otherwise 🙄) and the only thing I had going for me was classes and no extracurriculars. Naturally, I got really bad junioritis and joined almost everything at my high school. I managed to survive with only one anxiety attack and only moderate burnout come May.

I get anxiety over saying no to things and will work myself to a break down to remain constantly busy. Obviously that’s not healthy or sustainable.

Hi My name is Amy but that's not my real name, I'm only 14 years old,I'm not from Cebu but I'm from Mindanao,In the city of Iligan .

So I wanted to share my life story to you, so actually today, I'm starting to think that I'm depressed why? Because I cry 3 times to 5 times every week, I sometimes plan to commit suicide but I just can't do it, and I also skip breakfast, lunch and sometimes even dinner, yes I have friends, they asked me if I had ate breakfast or lunch I just simply give them my fake smile and tell them that I already ate, I don't know why I'm lying to them but I just did, actually I'm a rebelious child I speak back to my parents, I don't listen to them and sometimes I even wished they were dead by now but....I just said those because I'm angry at them.

At school I'm popular for being the school dancer and I was also known as the Rebelious Teenager, I own that tittle because, I yelled at my teacher and even course her I was almost suspended but the principle gave me another shot.

It’s happened to me in high school with my ex-bestfriend and now my roommate. Both of them share the same personality that can be summed up as: super insecure so they attack/size up those they view as “threats” or superior. Basically big Napoleon complexes. Now I don’t particularly think I’m superior than others nor am I conceited, but I am aware I was blessed with certain things. I’m tired of my roommate constantly attacking me for things I work hard for.

In comparison to my roommate I am skinnier (she’s extremely insecure about herself being overweight), taller, in a happy relationship, have a higher GPA, and I guess prettier by societal standards. Everything besides height I work towards. I wake up at 6AM to work out and spend most of my time studying. She on the other hand sleeps until 1pm and plays video games all the time. Yet she has the audacity to complain about being fat when she has all the time in the world to work on herself. I offered to go to the gym with her and she refuses like what the heck?? 

I’m so sick of her constant complaining and bullying. However, I don’t think we are able to sit down and talk because I know she won’t listen, especially if I take charge. If I do anything that’s leadership-like she immediately dejects me. I don’t know what to do anymore, how come I’m getting attacked for being good to myself smh.

TL;DR My roommate is jealous of traits I work hard towards and attacks me for being superior. What should I do?

I've had two dentists tell me nothing is wrong with me and that it's a result of my orthodontic treatment (my braces) in high school. But I'm paranoid and I fear I actually have periodontal disease or gum disease. It must be the stress, which makes it so much scarier because college is always going to be a stressful time for me. So my gums will never stop receding. At this point my roots are becoming exposed, and I'm getting really scared.

I reschedule, reschedule, keep rescheduling and they don't even try to reschedule. I'm always the one reaching out, always the one trying to ask how was their day. I listened and laughed with them when they were struggling and cried alone when it came to my own struggles. 

You all claimed that maybe it's my fault, that I don't try hard enough, that I don't open up enough. It's always my fault. My fault. My fault.

Maybe you're right. I know I'm not the best of people. I know that I have my quirks. I know that I sometimes say the wrong things. I know I'm not cool, pretty, smart, funny.

I am disgusted by how easy it was to play the graders for my DEI course.
So I having had more than 12 units that quarter, decided to take my DEI for pass no pass just to have one less course to worry about. 
So on one assignment, I straight up didn't read it, so what I did was I read the title, and the first 2 or 3 sentences of each paragraph just to kind of get an idea of what was happening. and just related it to me being Asian and my ""struggles"" that I heavily exaggerated and made analogous to the topic, and got an A on it. So again, I'm Asian, and the TA responsible for grading me was a white woman. So what I did was I played around with her, and tried writing things with the same strategies and noticed that all it took was relating to how things are either problems for women, or problems for Asians. The reason for this strategy was because I believed that she would appreciate me exaggerating women's problems that don't really exist, and that she felt she couldn't challenge me on my bullshit because she doesn't know what it's like to be Asian. and sadly to say it did work. and just to really confirm it, I tried one paper where I actually did read the readings, and objectively wrote about it and then changed gears and undermined the women's issue that was being discussed, and got a bad score on it. 

And the reason I decided to write this now is because I did get a full time job. and Nothing I've learned in my DEI is worth a fuck to the company nor to me.

and so I can fairly say that the DEI was a waste of my time and money. and fuck you UCSD for making me take it.

Little did I know of just how sus, crazy and fake she is. Like I never really noticed certain things about her, but the longer I lived with her, the more and more I started disliking her. She always tries to be the center of attention, never apologizes even though she knows shes in the wrong, tries to victimize herself in every situation as to seem that she didn't do anything wrong, and all around fake. She would also have a different problem everyweek and would be in a depressed mood, we would try to help her out but she literally had a new problem each week so we just grew tired of trying to even help her, seeing as though she rarely listen to our advices or is even appreciative of it. Its not just me either, some of our other friends that knows about the situation also have started to dislike her, but those that doesn't know still adore her and doesn't think anything wrong of her. I dont want to ruin their image of her because I don't think its my place to tell them what to think of a person but I also think its unfair that they hold her on this pedestal and believe her to be this great person.

I don't really know what to do. I know that she has some mental issues (depression, suicidal thoughts) and by pushing her away more I feel like it might get worse for her. Like I said, some of our mutual friends have also distanced themselves from her too so she doesn't have the support system that she used to have but also I don't want to be fake. I don't want to pretend that I'm there for her when I'm not anymore or that everything is fine and dandy. We already rarely talk anyways even though we share the same room, but I still have a whole quarter to live with her and it just seems my home has become an unwelcoming environment.

Unrelated to why I dislike her now, but I think she might be gay. She had this weird fascination with one of our girl friend (which i think she liked) and ever since our friend got a boyfriend she started acting worse.

11065,2019-04-09 22:54:35,"@10846 saying you’d rather a flat out rejection from girls instead of them trying to let you down nicely, it’s tough to do since from my experience, guys can take it quite personally. For example, once I was in a friend group where there was only 1 other girl and 6 other guys, we were all friends but the guys were closer. One of them liked me, I tried letting him down nicely and curving him pretty obviously, and when I eventually flat out rejected him he was all “_______ is a bitch, she’s a hoe anyways, she wears too much makeup i probably wouldn’t recognize her if we were dating and she got too comfortable and showed me her bare face” etc etc. really mean and hurtful things, and it influenced the way the other guys in our friend group saw me and they all stopped talking to me. 

I think a lot of girls feel this way, even if it might not be exactly like my situation i mentioned. Guys get hurt when they’re flat out rejected, and then they talk shit about the girl just for not reciprocating feelings. Sure, not all guys are like that, but how can we tell if they are or aren’t? Guys will be very sweet to a girl they’re interested in and then, like a switch, they suddenly become assholes when they realize she doesn’t feel the same. If they’re only pretending to be nice so that we like them back, we can’t tell if they’re genuinely the type to handle the rejection well or not.

I would eat as much as I could, drown myself in protein shakes and workout religiously. And the best part was I was seeing great results, I was becoming more muscular and starting to fill out my cloths. But one thing no one ever tells you about eating a lot of protein or a lot in general is the incessant flatulence you accrue. Fast forward to the start of a quarter, I had a writing class around noon of that day so I figured I could get a quick workout in. I hit up Rimac, got that sick pump bro and went home as fast as possible to take advantage of that anabolic window. I sloshed together the most putrid yet protein and calorie dense shake UCSD has ever known. I pinched my nose and knocked back the vile gains elixir. I had 15 minutes left before the start of the writing class so I changed and ran over. I found a middle seat and the class started on time. The professor began going over the syllabus and eventually requested we write a little about ourselves and turn it in before leaving. It had been a little over an hour since I had the shake, and at this point my GI tract was wrenching, bloating, contorting and growing. I was immediately trapped. I was frozen in my seat; the reality of what may happen struck me all at once. I ordered my rectum to batten down the hatches, shut the sphincter, all hands on the poop deck. But it was to no avail, much like a failed 1 rep bench press max with no spotter I needed to bail out from under the barbell. In the complete silence surrounding me I farted with the combined energy of 10000 suns.

It's kinda cool if you ask me, but it can also get really bad an depressing. Eg. Not being able to dance to a song at the club because my memory linked to it would be of a guy I considered my friend sexually assaulting me.

10822,2019-04-03 01:54:47,"Hey, so there have been recent posts about fat people. I really don't take offense to these post because I know I'm fat and would never consider myself curvy. I do believe that America's body positivity has taken a turn where obesity should be accepted but it kinda shouldn't. Being obese fucking sucks, not for looks (you are beautiful), but for health. I had a diabetes scare that really put shit into perspective. I know I can make myself beautiful with the right clothes and makeup but that will not make up for the fact that my health is in decline. 

However, there is a reason on how I got myself to be this. During middle school I was actually an average weight but I got depressed and found comfort in food when I couldn't it find in others. It took me awhile to just accept the fact that I'm fat. 

The type of ""harsh"" comment was made but it won't actually do anything. Only skinny people would agree with you (with the exception of me) and others would go agaisnt you. Fat people may call themselves curvy in order to cover the blow of being fat, but it is better promote workouts and diets than degrading fat people.

Degrading people just makes the people hate you and go against you. 

If I'm going to kill myself due to obesity at least let me die peacefully. I get that you might be ""concerned"" but in all honesty just let me walk with a crop top, with my Dora the Explorer belly without having to be concerned of being an eyesore for others.",[redacted],,,Wed,66.03300000000011,38.11500000000003,36.629999999999995,0.14,0.712,0.148,-0.1751,01

10692,2019-04-02 02:45:39,"One night in the Summer I finished fifth grade, my mom became homeless… It was that night I knew exactly what hate felt like. You don’t know what hate is until you’ve been in a kitchen at four or five in the morning when your dad is finally knocked out from all the booze and porn he edits and watches in the same tiny ass room as you, your sister, and your mom. Until you’ve held a knife, clutching it with all your strength just wanting to pierce it through his heart. 

Hate doesn’t start off that way though. It doesn’t because it’s a gradual build. 

Dad first hits your mom. You’re just a little boy, terrified of what you just saw. Confused even. Almost all the movies you watched and all your friends’ families growing up had loving parents who cared for each other. 

Then dad starts to hit your mom even harder, and he starts to hit you. Now, you’re kept up all night just daydreaming about grabbing that knife, but you can’t. You don’t have the guts to do it. I don’t think anyone ever has the guts to do it. 

He keeps hitting you, your mom, and now your sister. He still drinks. He still edits and watches porn in front of you and says nothing but insults to you. At this point, you can’t help but sit up, lie down, sit up, lie down, sit up, lie down, sit up, lie down. Just thinking of the consequences of murder. Then one night you find yourself standing with your fist clenched so tight you can break dad’s neck. Then at the kitchen door with your hands on the knob, going through all the possible scenarios. All you want to do is punch a giant fucking hole in that door.

Then finally. My mom comes home late from her closing shift at the restaurant. I still don’t know what they were fighting about (or what they ever fought about) to this day because I can barely speak Korean. All I know is that this was the fight that almost ended my entire life and his. 

The fight ended with dad throwing our mini foldable table at my mom and grabbing her by the ear or hair dragging her on the floor out of our tiny room and out of the house. I’ve never wondered what the other tenants of the house were doing or thinking, while listening to dad yell, hearing me and my sister cry our asses off, and probably trying to block out my mom’s screams and pleas, until now as I’m writing this. It’s kind of weird. Although I now wish someone had come help us, I’m glad no one did. This night made us stronger and more prepared for what’s to come. 

He comes back, slams the door, and sits down at his desk. He doesn’t say a single word. I looked at my sister and I will never forget how frightened and angry she looked. I was waiting for her to stand up, grab me, and walk outside to be with our mom. It never happened. We never talked about this night, but I can only assume she was waiting for me too. Dad finally turns around and tells us to not even dare help our mom. Neither of us did, and she was forced to sleep on the balcony stairs right outside the window of our room. All I could do was look up at the window from the floor. I couldn’t look any closer because I was too scared to see my mom actually outside. I stared at the window, the floor, the window, the floor, the window until dad finally laid his blankets on the floor right in front of me and fell asleep. This was the night I skipped all the indecisiveness, the reasoning, and the daydreaming. This was the night I went straight to the knife. 

As you can tell, I couldn’t find the guts to do it that night since I’m here at UCSD and not in prison. There are still some moments I wish I had done it to this day, and there are others I am glad I didn’t. 
Thanks for reading this. I know it’s very long. I’ve never talked about this night and the feelings this explicitly to anyone before. I try to have nothing but love to as many people as possible, and I hope this story moves all of you to be more kind, selfless and loving to those around you.

Dad was an alcoholic, was a pornographer and edited that shit right in front of me and my sister in that tiny ass room. He also beat the living shit out of us and my mom.
 the first friend i ever made in LA in 6th grade was one of the very few who helped me get through that shit and understood me cause his family was fucked up too. we actually met in detention the first week of school lmao prolly rlly hard to believe since we were so little, but middle school was pretty fucking lit not gonna lie. 
anyways.. we had to go to different high schools, and holy shiit! how different our lives turned out. 
my dad died right before high school (lowkey good riddance) and since he always told me id end up homeless and a beggar cause of how stupid he thought i was, I really wanted to try hard in high school and now here i am in UCSD studying MechE with a 3.6 GPA. Hopefully i find a job after graduation.. i get hella scared my dad was right all along. he haunts the shit outta me... ghosts are fucking real yall and theyre scary af. 
in contrast tho.. my friend went to highschool with our other friends in middle scbool. most of em became drug dealers and jumped into a gang including my first friend. he recently got outta prison and we finally had a conversation after 7 or 8 years on instagram (sadly we coulsnt video chat cause my girlfriend is already sleeping.) forgot to mention he wasnt a citizen so he got deported. really glad to hear that hes really motivated to start a new life and study programming tho.

I really don't care if you smell like sweat, we are in a GYM but my god, whatever you were wearing was so pungent that I could barely resist the urge to gag. Did you really have to come use the treadmill right next to me? There were at least 5 other ones that were not being used. I had just broken a personal best time and I was really reluctant to end my run but after about 20 minutes, I was starting to get a headache from your stench. This isn't the first time this has happened either. Ladies, (guys too but I've only experienced this with females) if you are going to workout, PLEASE don't spray an entire bottle of perfume on yourself. Better yet, don't wear any perfume or scented products at all. It is so inconsiderate and makes it really hard to do cardio workouts because breathing obviously intensifies and having to breathe in your perfume each time makes it really hard to keep working out. If you can't stand the thought of smelling like nothing when going to a gym, then can you at least go do your workout away from other people so nobody has to smell it? Like at least spray an aromatherapy oil on yourself so I can at least feel relaxed when your stench particles violate my nostrils.

If you really wanted trump impeached. You could have done it a long goddamn time ago. And the evidence for his crimes is literally public knowledge. He made an executive airstrike that killed an American 8 year old girl. he broke the emoluments clause by keeping his hotels in international countries which were then used to meet for foreign affairs with foreign officials. He used campaign money to fuck a pornstar. 

The Russia investigation wasn't at all about impeaching him. It was about the Democrats not wanting to admit they lost to trump. Well you know what, let me say it. They lost. You lost. We lost. There's no if and or buts about it. The republican party threw the election running the dumbest fucking man to have ever attempted politics, and somehow the Democrats fucked up worse and got a person that not even the Democratic firewall was willing to vote for.

And you know what, the Democratic party did deserve to lose. The country's liberal population wanted universal healthcare. You had a popular candidate that campaigned for it, and one that didn't. The DNC favored the one who didn't just because she didn't look like somebody the Republicans can easily accuse of communism and you fucking lost because of it. Plain and simple, you fucked up 

And the other thing that pisses me off the most is this. If all you needed to ""rig"" an election was russinian trollbots what does that say about the election? What does that say about your candidate if all it takes is unverified facts to make 3 states that always voted Democrats to all of a sudden vote republican? That just means your candidate SUCKED. Now if you're convinced Russia rigged the actual counts of Cotes that's a different story. But if all they did was propagate false info and that's all it took to get a turd like trump to the office then you know what, you deserved it. If you ran a likable candidate instead of trying to run some power hungry lady that's just running because she felt it was ""her turn"" after Obama, you deserve the loss. And I don't say this as a republican or a Democrat or any political party. I say this as somebody who doesn't subscribe to a party and looks at politics from a neutral point of view, nobody deserves the horror that is Donald Trump but there is no doubt in my mind that the Democratic party dug their own grave running Clinton and that's nobody's fault but theirs.",,,,Fri,74.97000000000003,61.29900000000016,62.32799999999994,0.186,0.733,0.081,-0.9956,16

It’s super difficult for me to make friends because I’m super quiet/introverted/socially awkward. I want to make more friends but idk how too. It's really difficult for me to talk to others because I’m not sure what to say. I feel so lonely. I feel like I don’t fit in. I always feel left out by my suite-mates and I feel that no one, not a single person legitimately likes me. My roommates get along really well but I just feel left out like I don’t even exist. People use me as well. They use all the things I have, most times without asking. I’m super nice and I like helping others but when I need help, no one comes through. I feel super depressed and I drink a bunch of alcohol and I started doing drugs to cheer me up about my crappy life. I really want to commit suicide and I attempted it like 2 years ago, maybe nows the time :( I just feel so down and out and people say “It’ll get better”  or “you’ll get through this” but I feel thats bs. I just don’t have the will to continue and my grades have suffered significantly. My gpa is below 2.0 and that makes me even more depressed/sad. Im not motivated and I miss most of my classes. People also make fun of me. Like when literally anyone talks to me, I just cheer up and it makes my day. Like I got hugged from a friend and I got teary. When I see people happy, I get kinda sad because I know I’m missing out. I’m also fairly insecure. I have family issue but its not super bad but still an issue that stresses me out. Im also atheist but I’m scared to tell my parents because of their feelings and how they’re going to take it. I told them I’m depressed and they say its a fad that kids do these days. I cant open up and express my feelings without being judged. High-school also sucked so much and I know college is different and all but that impacts me as a person so much. On the outside, I look like I’m fine/happy but on the inside I’m just crying. Everyone struggles and fights their own battles but I just need help from someone, just someone to console me. Like when one of my suite-mates says “goodnight” to me, I get so fucking happy.  I’m not sure wether I should leave my contact info or not. I don’t know what the reaction to this will be. My biggest fear is that someone will figure out who wrote this and that scares me. One of my suite-mates really degrades me personally, and I feel like doing something to him. I hate being myself.  My main struggle is just being so damn lonely and not being extroverted. Ive just given up of life at this point. I over think about my flaws and all. (don't want to be specific it’ll become obvs) I feel like a fucking mess who is just fucked up. I just want to cry and let my feelings out but I have no one to talk to and I feel as a guy there is a stigma associated with expressing feelings. I'm writing this at 5am crying.

10528,2019-03-22 17:06:51,"I hate seeing how social media has marketed anxiety and depression like it's ""quirky"" or some shit. As someone with major depressive disorder, it fucking sucks, and I hope no one else ever has to experience it. IT'S NOT QUIRKY OR TRAGICALLY BEAUTIFUL. IT'S DRAINING AND EXHAUSTING.
It's not just being sad--at least not for me. It's feeling numb and empty, not getting excited over things I know I should be excited for. It's eating food you usually like and tasting nothing. Everything is bland, and you force yourself to eat for sustenance. It's having no motivation to do even the smallest things, like getting up to shower or brushing my teeth. Like, these are basic things I know I /should/ do, but on my bad days, I can't even bring myself to do them. I can't even bother to change out of two-day-old clothes. I can't even motivate myself to eat for fuck's sake, and because of that, I feel even more disgusting and gross. And the thing that sucks is, other people probably just think I'm lazy. It gets worse when it comes to school. I /know/ I have to get out of bed to go to lecture and lab, but some days, I just don't, and I feel guilty every time I have to email a professor or TA about my absence or turning in late work because my brain is like ""you don't deserve to do this! you were just lazy!"" when logically I know it's because of my mental illness. You know what else sucks? No matter how much sleep I get, I'll still feel tired, whether its the meds or the illness--I'll never know lmfao. And the days just go by, and on really bad weeks, I feel so detached, it's like I'm just watching myself go through the motions of life. I'm not even living. Depression and anxiety aren't quirky, and I've been dealing with them since high school. They stole my youth, so stop acting like they're some sort of personality trait. Also, institutions of higher education (or, well, educational institutions in general) need to improve how they support their mentally ill students.

It’s just funny how all that can change if my parents knew (and therefore condemned me) of my homosexuality. This isn’t something I like to say to my friends, because I’d hate to make them worry, but suicide has been (now more than ever) a possibility I’ve considered throughout much of my adolescence, and even has been something I have made attempts at. This feeling of dread I have now because of my fear of getting caught is so paralyzing, and sometimes I feel like the only way to reassume mastery over my life is to end it. Since years have passed I’ve embraced the notion that suicide is never an answer, but sometimes it’s more than just an ‘answer’, I sometimes it’s just wanting to be able to breathe again. I don’t know where this ramble is taking me, but I do know that this perpetual struggle of keeping my identity secret from my family is exhausting. I’ve had the stamina to last this long under the guise of the son/brother they expected me to be, but it has taken everything from me. I want to last, I really do, but I don’t know how much time I have left. ",,"trigger warning, serious",,Wed,19.488000000000014,23.577000000000044,14.789999999999996,0.137,0.716,0.147,-0.3834,23

10245,2019-03-18 18:14:52,"Seriously fuck my roommates. 

To them: Almost a month a go you went behind my back and talked serious shit about me and my relationship with my boyfriend with one of our mutual ""friends"". I trusted you. I knew we were kind of growing apart, but I tried fucking hard to stop that. I've woken up at 4 am to take you to the train. I was there when you were going through some serious things. I held you when you got home at 3 am crying. I've driven you to school (15 minutes each way) more times than I can count. I tried to be a good friend to you guys, to involve you, to make sure you're included. 

I held off on posting this for so long but I need to get it off my chest. Me I could deal with. I have my boyfriend to ground me. But the fact that you did this again with another person in the house? Really? Right before finals? Talking shit about her and her relationship. Lying to her, going behind her back. Betraying her trust?? That's how you treat someone you love and live with? I hate to see how you treat someone you don't like. Oh right, you treat them like you treat me. Ignoring my existence. Talking shit behind my back. She's seriously hurting right now. Almost suicidal. You knew this wasn't okay or you wouldn't have tried to keep it from her. I don't know how to help. She won't let me help.

I hate that you guys still matter to me. I hate that I would still drive you to the train at 4 am. You suck. I suck. Fuck all of you.",,rant,,Mon,19.33900000000002,57.60200000000008,40.17200000000008,0.216,0.62,0.164,-0.9712,18

10343,2019-03-16 22:19:00,"I fucked up. I fucked up so bad. It’s been a year and a half with my boyfriend, the most amazing man I’ve ever been with in my life. He treated like royalty. He did anything for me literally anything and loved me unconditionally. Before I began college (I’m a freshman) and before I even dated him, i always dreamt of living the single college life going to parties and having fun talking to boys and all that. When I got here my first week I cheated. I know. Don’t give me the well it’s your fault I know it is. Back then my mentality was i Want to experience some college fun. It lasted more than just one time, me and this boy started to have a little fling every now and then meanwhile I was telling my boyfriend i loved him. I hate myself so much for it. Just two days ago he found out and it broke both of our hearts. I tried my hardest to fight for our relationship and to my surprise, he took me back. I couldn’t believe it. I’m enternally grateful for it but I know his heart is shattered. It breaks my heart that I broke his. This makes me never want to go ‘ experience college ‘ I just want to be with him forever. I want him to treatment like he did but he can’t even kiss me he says because he imagines me doing it to the guy. I just wanna move past it and be all in love again. The thing is I don’t know if we’ll ever been the same and that scares me to death. If things aren’t the same why be together. Idk. Just venting, don’t expect comments. I can’t even tell my friends because it’ll make me look bad. He turned off his location, doesn’t tell me where he goes anymore he tries his hardest to ignore me but eventually gives in. I don’t blame him I don’t even deserve it.Today he came over to my house and that was nice. Just happened 2 days ago too. I lied about what I told him too. I told him we didn’t have sex but we did, probably 4-5 times. He has a gut feeling I did too but I can’t tell him that or he will really leave. I also can’t tell him that the first time we had sex the guy came inside of me, something I didn’t expect him to do at all and I was scared to death and we went to buy plan b together. I can’t ever tell my bf this he would really hate me. I just told him we kissed 3 times. Even with that he’s broken I can’t imagine him knowing everything and I still feel so shitty and guilty.

as a white upper-middle class (mostly) straight man i know have an abundance of privilege. my dad always said we should be grateful for how fortunate we are but never related it to those less fortunate. i relate to the idea that i can come to college for the “experience” but often feel guilty. it’s upsetting that people can look at me with condescension and disgust so i try to never mention my family or our experiences out of guilt. 

On a more positive note, i’ve realized that my reason to work harder is how privileged i am. every time i hear that i’m “fortunate” to go to college i say bullshit, this should be an option for everyone. everyone deserves the same opportunities that i was “fortunate” to have, if not more.

We don't mean any of the things we say but goddamn we can't say a joke without some jackass ethnic studies majors eavesdropping and saying ""OMG that's so racist."" And the thing that pisses me off the most is it's always the white person in our circle that gets the most shit while the other 3 of us crack the most offensive jokes to him about how he's an incest bred school shooter (and for the record he's really not but doesn't stop us from cracking the jokes).

And I really think it's just fucking ethnic studies and other garbage majors just deluding people from reality. Yes racism is real, but so are jokes. And they're not the same thing. There is no hate between us 4 when we crack jokes about how my dick is small (I'm Asian) or he jumped a boarder and is hiding from the cops or how he was put in a gas chamber as a child. We don't mean the shit we say. We're just 4 guys having fun with each other

But whenever an ethnic studies majors gives us shit, we all just go in glassdoor and tho in ethnic studies and laugh at how at most one position is open at any time if even that. Have fun being broke while we earn our engineering and trade degrees and earn enough to feed families

Since I’m symptom free and take antivirals my partner would have a bigger risk of knocking me up than getting herpes (with a condom it’s <2% F to M transmission rate per year), but guys always freak out about it and say some shit like “Well I’m not trying to catch any diseases, but how about you suck my dick?” without any reciprocation.  Most of these guys have never even been tested for it and don’t even realize that most people who have it are asymptomatic (so they likely already have type I or II) and if they already have type I (cold sores), then they likely have enough antibody resistance naturally to not catch type II.  The only reason I know is because I specifically asked my Dr. for the antibody test after my ex tested positive.  Most people get cold sores and no one makes a big deal out of it, but as you have type II, the world freaks TF out and treats you like a slut.  I’ve also seen pharm techs make posts on IG about how disgusted they feel if a person is picking up antivirals and tried to hit on them.  It makes me feel like we are to be defined by this and treated like disgusting unworthy people.  We need love too.  I feel so conflicted telling partners about it now (my nurse said that if she were me she wouldn’t tell anyone), but I think that illegal and I’m afraid of getting sued like Usher.

 You literally described what I have been feeling for the past week. I do not use Grindr for hookups, rather I use them for hang outs and dates and cuddles. Literally everything you have described is what I feel, on the dot, initial presumption of meaningful connection, getting ghosted, them messaging first :( I'm up for it if you are down to cry together and relate to these experiences together, if that counts as a meaningful connection. :'((((""

Among other things, he has a ridiculous grading scale (97% is an A-, 94% is a B+, ... 74% is an F).  He also says that if you are as much as ONE SECOND LATE to lecture more than one time, you receive an automatic F in the entire course.

I'm just me! I'm tired of disappointing women. I'm tired of feeling like I need to be more masculine or more dominant or whatever the hell. I'm tired of being undesirable. I just want to know where I can go to find somebody who is actually into me for who I am. Are there communities I do not know about? Can anybody help me find them?

Because of the noise that the kickback made, a RSO came over and demanded to be let in so the girl throwing the kickback let him in. He wrote everyone up, even my friend who was just taking care of me, saw me puking and called 911, and an ambulance came and I was dragged to the hospital. I have three problems with this: 
1. I can't use insurance because my parents are crazy and would pull me out if they knew about this, meaning that I would have to pay out of my own pocket in full. I just looked up an ambulance ride and I am shell shocked because they range around $3000. 
2. I'm a student leader on campus and I plan to move up in my org, but me being written up will maybe shatter my reputation in my org and the dean (who I know fairly well) will hate me and I might not be able to run for the position that I want.

I know it's been a while since we've seen each other but I've been missing the nice talks we would have and the way we could just cuddle and not say anything but still enjoy our time together. I have wanted to contact you again but I keep remembering how much you would complain about not having an SO and how you were afraid of never finding someone to be with. I would have been with you! We had a genuine connection and I would have showered you with so much love and affection. Too bad you were an idiot and rejected me because of my race. For someone who constantly retweets anti-racism videos and comments and is going to be a doctor, you sure do have some conflicting ideologies that you hurt people with. Maybe instead of putting forth so much effort in maintaining a facade through social media, you should focus on who you are in real life and try to improve on that instead. Lord knows there's space for improvement.

As we get closer to finals, you might be getting frustrated with your class. Material hard, work is long, and your TA can be frustrating. Before you take it out on them, though, please take a second to step back and look at them.
They're students and people. Most of them are working 10+ hours a day before factoring in TAing. Their work is competitive and demanding, and most suffer from depression. And to top it off, they're actually not that much older than you. If you're a senior finishing off your gen ed reqs, chances are your TA is only a year older than you and expected to run your class with confidence.
So please, take a second to remember your TA, because while a lot of us can be bitter, depressed, and overall just hate every second of our lives, seeing a student appreciate it or at least tolerate us at our worst can really be a bright point in our day.",,serious,,Thu,29.22400000000002,19.084000000000028,26.0,0.166,0.75,0.084,-0.9551,18

Labon and Palmilla Dr bus stop students, it is raining and the line is long. I'm sure everybody knows where the line starts! When there is a HUGE line, it's very rude to cut everybody in line and go to the front, even if you live closer around IG. The line flows from the bus stop to around the corner FOR A REASON. The bus stops at the front, so if you stop at the front, you are getting in first. Normally when the 202 bus can fit everybody, it is still bad, but at least we can make it to school. When 4 full busses pass, and you get on before everyone else who has been waiting bus after bus, that is very wrong to just cut int the front! I would tell you to go to the back of the line, but since I was at the back, I could not go to the front. SO PEOPLE AT THE FRONT WHO MADE IT THERE, DO YOUR PART AND TELL THEM THAT THE END OF THE LINE IS OVER THERE BACK. If not for yourself, do it for the people who have been waiting bus after bus. 
The reason this needs to be addressed is because there was a line today, and because of ONE or TWO people, THE LINE WAS GROWING THE OTHER WAY. IT SNOWBALLS. So people who got here last, who don't know where the end of the line is, are at the beginning, and they get on the bus first! This doesn't make sense, just go to the back of the line. I come from the IG side, and I know it is unfair the end of the line is farther away, but you can't do anything about the fact that the bus runs the way it does. It stops at the first person at the bus stop. so logically the end is the OTHER side. ",,,,Tue,52.92000000000004,54.0,79.272,0.09,0.889,0.021,-0.9621,09

My freshmen year I hooked up with this guy off Grindr and it was pretty hot. Let’s call him jack. I hooked up with him four more times over the past two years. The more I hung out with him, the more I realize jack was a shitty human being so I blocked him on Grindr. He then proceeded to make new accounts and tell me that he was going to find me and rape me. I was scared so I stopped using Grindr for a while. I downloaded it again today and this guy wanted to hook up. He was hot so I was down. I got to his place and turns out it was jack the whole time. He told me that all he wanted to do was talk. I was scared out of my mind and I felt like I was going to be killed. I listened to him ramble about how disrespectful I was, and how he thinks about me all the time. I told him I wanted to leave. Jack said he wanted to have sex with me one last time. I told him I didn’t want to. He told me that if I didn’t have sex with him, he was going to leak all my explicit photos all over ucsd and that he would keep pursuing me. If I had sex with him, then I would never see him again. I decided to have sex with him to get it over with. I wanted this to end.  I cried during it. He didn’t care. I just left his place.

An unfortunate student wearing airpods and riding a bird scooter was his first victim. I remember his cries as Shaggy picked him up and examined this new prey. 

""OH GOD, I'VE GOT AIRPODS ON, I CAN'T HEAR YOU! I DON'T SPEAK BROKE!"" the student cried, but Shaggy ignored his rambling and swallowed him whole (much to my relief). However, Shaggy was still hungry, and he locked his eyes onto me, his next target. 

I did the only thing that any sweaty CS nerd who hasn't showered in 5 weeks would do.

I ran back to my reshall. 

I ran fast, the fear of Shaggy still fresh on my mind. After what felt like an eternity of running, I finally made it to the door and shut myself inside of my bedroom, hoping that I lost him. Shaggy was not to be deterred. Within a few seconds, his Ultra Instinct has guided him straight to my reshall. There was no escape.

I trembled in fear as I heard the footsteps coming closer. 

""He's here!"" I audibly gasped. ""Oh god he's here... Shaggy is coming to the reshalls to SWALLOW me whole!"" I turned to the only beacon of help in this forsaken dorm - my body pillow of the one and only Gillespie-sama. 

I wept, for the end was near, and fell to my knees. Tears came down my cheeks as I clasped my hands together and prayed ""Please save me, Gary-sama."" 

It was no use, the footsteps came closer and closer to the door of the reshall, and I could hear a loud ZOINKS! as the door came flying off its hinges. ""This is how it ends."" I thought to myself. Shaggy's fist made a hole in my bedroom door, and his menacing visage followed. At that moment, I thought all was lost.

At that moment, a miracle happened. Gary Gillespie came bursting through the window, with his knife in one hand and the keys to a Lexus in the other. 

The atmosphere was intense. Shaggy stared at Gary, but Gary returned his gaze. 
""How unprofessional of you, Shaggy-san,"" Gary laughed. ""I thought after our battle ten years ago that you would learn not to attack my worshippers. Since you have broken this matter of principle, I shall deduct professionalism from your body.""

Shaggy didn't reply, his murderous eyes were fixed on Gary's. All of a sudden, Shaggy lunged for Gary's throat. 

""Watch out Gary-sama!"" I cried, but Gary was quicker. He ducked and grabbed Shaggy by his green shirt. 

""NANI THE HELL GARY BRO?"" Shaggy cried, dumbfounded. Gary didn't hesitate and deducted 100% professionalism from Shaggy. 

""Unfortunately for you Shaggy-chan, it's a sad situation"", Gary spoke triumphantly, and smashed Shaggy's body, dignity, and dining dollars to bits with his mustache.

So I had a date tonight. I met her online, we talked for at least a week, had a bunch of weirdly-specific common interests, and were enthusiastic about meeting up. She especially wanted to meet me, an had suggested seeing a show. So I bought tickets and we did. Admittedly, I was a little late, but I apologized profusely and she seemed cool with it. That was my only real fuck up. Anyway, due to the nature of the music (Indie rock), it went on until late and was fairly loud the whole time-we're weren't able to talk much. Then, I weirdly ended up seeing a couple friends from my HS (I'm from SD so it occasionally happens) so I talked with them for a hot couple minutes. After the show, I suggested getting some drinks or food...and she said she was tired. I kinda knew at that point, but she then flip-flopped and agreed to go to this small restaurant open late. So she then ends up standing me up there and lies saying that she was certain it was closed. As I'm there with a table. I apologize again for this apparently horrible date and ask if we could go on a better ""talking"" date to get to know each other. She refuses (I'll give her that she was polite about it) citing that I'm ""too extroverted and sociable"" for her. First off, I'm confused since I go to UCSD-I should be auto-classified as an introvert. Two, how did you judge my character after absolutely zero real conversations with me?! I'm not even mad she didn't want to date me, I'm just pissed that she judged me super rudely and didn't give me a chance. And of course, maybe she didn't find me attractive in person which is completely valid. Although it is a bit ironic coming from a person who was a good 25lbs heavier in person! And yet I didn't judge her. I gave her a chance to be beyond just a body. And I'm stuck with feeling a mix of anger at her judgement, and sadness that I offended/ strongly put her off somehow.

If you come into the lecture hall 5-10 minutes before it ends to sit down for your next class, you're a fucking shitty person

In lecture, somebody decides to walk into our room at Center. Person walks around up and down on one side, looks around, then walks in FRONT of the professor (she just kept going with lecture) and goes up the other side to sit down.

Like what the fuck, are you that desperate to get a seat for the next class (which is a stem class, probably cs) that you're willing to interrupt a lecture?

It was bad enough when people kept peeking and opening our door every 10-15 minutes to see if they could sit down (they still go inside the hall and peek when our door is open). Like damn, its the end of week 3, you should know that there is class before yours (MWF), you shouldn't keep coming in and expecting an empty room, nor should you keep looking in after seeing a class is in session. Just wait for the class to be over when it's SUPPOSED to be over, not 5 not 10 minutes before.

So yeah, I really don't like it when you come in OUR lecture time to try and find a seat for your next class, ESPECIALLY when there were a few people outside at the time, that you could have just waited a FEW more minutes before waltzing in there. Our professor rushed through the rest of our material and ended a few minutes early, because she probably thought she was already pushing it with the time. Bless her so much.

It's been on the back-burner for a while that I've been getting too attached, that other people's perceptions of us were going to come into play, but it's been nice having another person so I haven't bothered to confront it. We spent the day with one of my long-time friends and she was so uncomfortable with us that she stayed quiet the whole time and told me later that it was ""too much"" and she'd never felt more like a third wheel despite the fact that we're not an item. I decided I needed to take a step back, dial everything down a notch because I know I'm getting too attached (they're leaving after the summer, I'm not) on top of the fact that something finally gave and we're now making others uncomfortable. We talked, and I told them I needed to step back. They told me that they've known this conversation was coming for a while and felt... resigned to it. I don't know where they are mentally on this. I can't tell, and they're trying to keep it masked which makes it even harder.

My emotions here are weird, and I don't know why I feel like I've lost them already. I've probably fucked up a relationship that was amazingly comforting to have, and something hurts deep. I don't know if my feelings here bridge past platonic or if I'm just terrible at losing people, despite the fact we're still going to be friends. I don't know how badly this is affecting them, and it's not leaving my mind, no matter how much I distract myself. I lied and told them some half-truth about why I was stepping back, but the majority of the reason is I don't know how attached I'm getting. I can't find the lines between platonic and romantic and any other kind of love you want to list, and I don't know if it's because they've been indulging my desire for physical affection or because of something actual, something concrete. I can't let this drag the both of us down, can't let myself depend on them too hard and make myself incapable of function on my own, can't burden them with my strange crises and muddled feelings. I don't want to destroy whatever remains of our friendship to an uncomfortable nothing by saying that I might have feelings, especially if when I find the lines it turns out I was safely within normal zones. There's some guilt about the lie, but they're masking things from me right now, too, and it's only adding to the mess that's settling between us. 

I don't know what I'm going to do. If I should try and clean up whatever I've mussed by telling them the truth about why I'm stepping back. If I should just try and ride out whatever's left here. I keep wanting to text them and take the entire conversation back, but the reasons are too pressing to ignore. I don't know.",,"serious, long",,Mon,65.394,113.66099999999956,117.46700000000023,0.16,0.726,0.114,-0.9807,21

I went to the emergency room and honestly I will never do that again. They put me in a loud hallway, barely talked to me, and took all my stuff away. The doctor said I was medically fine but a social worker and psychiatrist needed to clear me so I had to wait. Then when a social worker finally talked to me (8 hours after I was admitted, so I already felt better and just wanted to go home) the social worker was an absolute asshole, pressuring me to make a decision and telling me that I needed to hurry up. Then when I made a decision he said I would have to be transported to a separate facility to be assessed even though the original doctor said I’d be assessed at the hospital. The entire experience made me feel more anxious and trapped and that was the last thing I needed. The experience was so terrible I honestly will never go to a hospital ever again if I feel suicidal or that anxious again. 
The way emergency room doctors deal with mental health is the opposite of what they need to do.

Rape fantasies are very, very common among women, especially in the US. Anywhere from 1 in 3 to 2 in 3 women admit to having rape fantasies, so chances are the new friends you get will also have similar fantasies.

Why? Well because of messy gender dynamics of course. Women are not supposed to seek out sex, but of course women also enjoy sex. So rape fantasies are a marriage between the two: a woman indulges in sex, but only against her will thus no guilt is involved. Rape also has themes of being dominated and so forth, which hits fairly common kinks.

Now that we said all that, keep in mind this is all just fantasy. This is your head exploring sexuality, so in the end you're still in control. This is why fantasies are sexy but real rape is not. I'd also advise you to tell your friends to be careful sharing their fantasies with their sex partners unless they trust them, because people get really weird about them.

8478,2019-01-03 00:37:50,"Three years ago on NYE I left the part I was at to go to my favorite spot in town that overlooked the bay, where I can see all the lights at night, and I bawled my eyes out because I never thought that I would make it past 18, let alone be in college. I've had major depression for the last 9 years. I have scars on my wrists and legs and arms, I've tried to kill myself a few times and have on a daily basis considered stepping out into the middle of traffic. I never thought I would make it this far. I never thought I wanted to make it this far. I have goals and ambition but random triggers pull me back all the time to my past experiences and it unravels all the progress I've made. On NYE the memory of me standing on that hill crying with pain and happiness flooded back to me. I thought about all that I have done since then and how much stronger I've gotten. I've come to terms with the realization that I can glue the pieces of me back together but I will never be perfect again, my cracks will always show. 

So, today may seem like a small day to you but to others just being here is a huge accomplishment. 

To those suffering from the hands of their past abuse I want to share something that I realized a little while back that is usually phrased for relationships: Every 7 years your body replaces all of its cells ( I know this is not entirely true, but it works for this), where in the future you can be assured that one day an ex you once loved will never have touched your new skin. But after hearing that statement a few times I realized that in the next few years I will have skin that was never touched by my abuser. So if you are struggling, know that one day, even though the memories are still there, you will one day have skin that was never hurt.

Good Luck in the new year and please remember that things can change for the better and that time can heal.",,trigger warning,,Thu,104.54400000000017,66.0,97.81199999999997,0.113,0.787,0.099,-0.7643,00

Do I not have the social media clout that everyone else has? Even in trying to be positive with people, I feel like they respect me even LESS when I do so. How can I be a more positive person when positivity is the very thing that pushes everyone away? These social concerns are the precise reason why I am afraid to leave school because honestly I am screwed when it comes to living my own independent life. Nobody will talk to me, and the social isolation will probably lead me to becoming jobless and homeless. So I cling to school even though it is rapidly coming to an end and I am not enjoying it. In some respects, I do want to quit school, and I can because I have satisfied the requirements for a different degree than the one I am working on. Yet I am screwed once school ends. It doesn't matter that I have a good gpa. I already know that I will not be able to make it through a job. I am already failing at making it through an internship. And ultimately, nobody will care.

I resent being Indian. 

The only reason I'm studying engineering is because the entire local community knows everything. I really hate that my mom talks about everything to everyone. And everyone expects me to be like my dad, a highly skilled engineer at a top company. Didn't occur to anyone that I love music, art, and dance way more. But one of my aunties pulls me aside and asks a bunch of financial questions about how I'm going to manage. I was 17 at the time, too. Like, you expect me to have my life plan at 17? And then she goes on this rant about how she's a doctor and she was able to get all of this because she could afford it, and how I'll never be able to do that with arts. I'm sorry, I don't really care about being rich. And her life would just be fucking miserable for me.

Doesn't help that I'm gay, and Indian people are stupidly homophobic. And the fact that I have a Korean boyfriend makes it worse. Indians are also hella racist. I'm sick of it all. I just want my parents to disown me so I don't have to put up with any of it. Or at the very least, they don't require me to meet anyone when I come home, and they stop talking about me.

8370,2018-12-26 12:28:09," TL;DR: I went on Tinder to get sex but got body dysmorphia instead. 
Tinder has successfully destroyed my self esteem and has made me utterly disgusted by my own self image. I have tried multiple different sets of photos all to no avail.  Over the course of a year I have done extensive work to improve my looks: incorporating exercise 6-7 days a week in my schedule (1-3 hours per session), I've have spent THOUSANDS of dollars on new clothing to enhance my style, I have tried (and am still trying) multiple different hairstyles  to find the one that best suits me, and a result of all this I have gotten a whopping NOTHING on Tinder. The only thing I haven't tried is plastic surgery, which I would be 110% down for if I knew that it would be almost guaranteed that I would benefit from it. 

But do you know what really fucking irks me? It's not the fact that in that year of feeble attempts to improve the way I look I didn't get anywhere remotely near a vagina, but the fact that I spent countless hours obsessing over my looks, starring into a fucking mirror wondering what to do to make myself more appealing to the opposite sex, comparing photos of myself to other guys to see what they have that I don't. I could have used that time to study more (which I desperately needed cuz UCSD) or become proficient at an instrument... 

I am understand that I am not entitled to intimacy or sex, but IT STILL FUCKING HURTS that I am not getting any. Go ahead, insult me, call me an incel, creep, ugly, entitled, WHATEVER YOU WANT, I don't need your fucking pity. Also, don't recommend me to go to CAPS or a therapist, I have been seeing a fucking shrink(s) for a while now. ""Maybe try working on your social skills so you don't rely on a superficial app like Tinder?"" Trust me, I have been fucking doing that too.

I just want girls to find me physically attractive...I guess it is time to move on with life...Who the fuck am I kidding I am probably just gonna continue to obsess over how I look, try a new look and another set of photos, rebuild my confidence, and TEAR IT ALL THE FUCK DOWN AGAIN WHEN I DON'T GET ANY PUSSY AGAIN.

If I do take adderall multiple times a week I get, at the least, passing grades. I take anywhere between 60-120 milligrams of adderall in one dose, at least 4 times a week. There have been nights where I stared up at my ceiling while lying in bed, my heart pounding dangerously close to 200bpm and my eyes open as wide as possible, where I was convinced I was going to die of a heart attack within the next few hours. Absolutely convinced and waiting for death. I've always dismissed my adderall usage as necessary to be a functioning member of society, but when I'm on adderall I become a reclusive, borderline psychotic person, clenching my teeth so hard that their alignment becomes disfigured and don't fit together properly anymore so I can't even bite down at all anymore. When I work on adderall, my work is not about getting the work done, it is about writing with the perfect handwriting. If I write any character that doesn't look exactly how I want it, I erase and rewrite till it looks perfect.

Not to mention that every time I take adderall it is not to get work done, it is simply to feel that jolt of motivational energy that makes it feel like anything that I do is productive and worthwhile. This means sometimes I take adderall and play single-player video games secluded in my room for 8-9 hours at a time. (I beat Red Dead Redemption 2 in five days, all side quests, legendary animals, and main story missions complete). I don't see an end to my adderall usage anywhere in the near future. My life revolves around adderall, I've stolen money from my parents to get adderall, I've lost friends due to adderall, my sober mind is always thinking about the next time I can take adderall. My lies about my life and usage are what caused my girlfriend of three years to break up with me. When I'm sober, I miss her so much that it physically hurts. So I take adderall just to be able to get my mind on other things. By other things I mean get my mind to obsess over one singular thing for 8-10 hours of the day before I inevitably crash and feel the need to either take more adderall, or ""sleep."" Moral of the story I guess, be very careful with adderall cause it can get its clenches on you and never let go.",[redacted],"serious, addiction",,Mon,26.134000000000093,161.63700000000003,108.83200000000016,0.099,0.811,0.09,-0.5283,05

I have been in and out of therapy for the past few years and ever since my first suicide attempt, which occurred on campus, my grades kept getting worse until I was eventually academically disqualified.  I took some time off and eventually took courses at a CC for a year and I was able to reapply to UCSD and be readmitted. This has been my first quarter back at UCSD after almost 2 years and the fucking hoops I have had to jump AFTER being readmitted have been ridiculous. First, the readmission process took FOREVER and by the time they readmitted me, all the classes had been filled and I had to take almost all electives because those were the only classes with open spots. Secondly, the financial aid office put me on probation and said I would have to pay my fees out of pocket each quarter until they could review my grades and decide if they will give me my loans for each quarter. Before I even started my Fall quarter, I had to borrow almost 5k from my boyfriend so I wouldn't be dropped from all of my classes and I will have to continue doing this before each quarter starts or else I will be dropped from everything and have to waitlist. Mind you, I am now a senior so I can't afford to be dropped from classes and get on a long ass waitlist for all of my classes. Thirdly, my major counselor fucked me over and told me to sign up for a class that I did not meet the prerequisites for so when I tried to sign up for this class, I couldn't. I told her about it and she said I will need to sign up for a 199 instead since I couldn't sign up for this research course on WebReg. How the fuck am I supposed to find a professor that will take a 199 student with an almost nonexistent GPA? And 2 quarters of this is required for my major. Fourthly, my grades came out for this quarter and even though my quarter GPA should have me in good standing, I just got a message telling me that I am subject to disqualification again because my cumulative GPA is still shit but even if I had received a 4.0 for this quarter, my cumulative GPA would have still been below a 2.0 so I don't how they expected me to pull my cumulative GPA up so much after just one quarter back??? I just feel like they are going to kick me out again even though I am trying to pass all my classes, keep my job so I can afford my rent, and do all of this while managing my mental illness pretty much on my own because my Kaiser therapist can only see me once every other month.

That does not in the slightest bother me that he posted a video of a dead body. and everybody who freaked out about are just self-righteous ass holes who can't mind their own business especially when they think they can profit off of bandwagoning hate for him. The person is dead. the person committed suicide. there's nothing you can do to bring him back, and not uploading a dead body isn't going to bring you any closer to having him back or stopping others from dying the same way. 

and for those of you thinking 'what if that was you', I'd be too dead to care.

and for those of you thinking 'what if that was your loved one', lemme tell you, losing a loved one is tragic as hell. but at that point, their body is useless to them and to me so what do i care if you post their body on the internet. 

stop worrying about the dead and start worrying about the problems we have now.

@#8092: i’m a fourth year and i’ve struggled for years trying to focus on studying for subjects and have trouble prioritizing tasks i need and want to do first. Do I doodle on my iPad? Or work on this function for my CS program? Oh wait, I could cook, study some mol bio, and at least two-three times while thinking of what else I would include in this sentence I forgot what I was thinking about (rip). 
I failed several CS classes because doing the long assignments was overwhelming and I would put things off to the last minute. Homework turned in for my non CS classes was usually incomplete. Just this year alone I lost my Apple Pencil, my watch for a month, three pairs of earbuds, a power bank, a jacket and (almost) lost my wallet at a con this year because some people are good Samaritans. 
——
I was diagnosed with ADHD earlier this year and i’ve been taking medication along with wanting to start therapy next year to help. It’s been immensely helpful in keeping me on just one task instead of eight but I know that I have to be careful using it.  
It saddens me hearing people taking adderall for tests when they don’t need it. Some college students with, you know, actual disorders need medication to function with a vestige of normality. Some don’t need and just require therapy, but the stigma for having meds is harder because people abuse it. 
——
I say this because I have a 2.7 gpa and a shit transcript because of the classes I failed. I probably can’t get into grad school for a while even though I really want to do research and become a professor. I was too late in trying to fix my problems and I think I could be in a much better spot if I acknowledged earlier that I had issues. 
I hope any of you who think about taking adderall or ADHD medication think twice if you weren’t prescribed it. If you are having legitimate problems and they were there before college, talk to CAPS! Treatment can help. I worry for those that face such stigma and were in a similar spot like I.    
——
I’m a little mad and I started to ramble, so I apologize. This isn’t a pity story. I’m not happy with my gpa because I should have been more proactive.

I'm afraid of fucking up a potential friendship by straight-up saying that I like them. At the same time, I wonder if that has already brought about a self-fulfilling prophecy. A lot of this is overthinking, it's just that the fear itself hurts, no matter how reasonable its basis (depression and anxiety at work.)

the one about the not wanting to drink because of your father. 
what I am saying is not trying to convince you to start drinking at all. But I never wanted to start drinking because my dad (who is now dead) was also an alcoholic who beat the shit out of my mom night after night in a studio apartment right in front of me and my sister who weren't even teenagers. 
I chose not to drink because I didn't want to be anything like my father. But my older cousin who also had an alcoholic dad told me (after he found i dont drink) that i shouldnt let a dead person who caused so much pain in my life and those I love to control any aspect of my life. He told me that my choice not to drink shouldn't have anything to do with my father. It should be my own decision. 
I still don't drink, except for the occasional beer on fridays after a long week, and two or three shots of soju on special occasions (since its rude to reject shots of soju from anyone older than you in korean culture haha)

I am in the most toxic relationship of my life and I had an overdose as a result of it over the weekend. I went to hospital, got checked out and convinced the doctor I would be fine to go home and be under supervision (that I don’t have) the next day.  I had all the motivation to go home write my papers and graduate this quarter but as soon as I got home from the hospital my bf went in the room to scream at me and blame me for things regarding his mental health. I know at times I have been horrible to him and maybe I deserve this treatment but I had just left the hospital for depression and had begged him to let me focus on my exams for the next couple of days. I had such a large panic attack i vomited. He tried again this morning but i shut it down before it began. I literally feel like i can’t take this anymore and I’ve lost all the motivation i had while in the hospital (+still in pain from pills). I want to leave desperately and would have the support to do it but I can’t help but to feel immensely guilty because he is struggling so much right now. How can you leave someone you love when they are at their lowest? Specially when you have helped contribute to their depression, debt and overall shit predicament.

7830,2018-12-06 19:01:09,"TLDR: HDH is toxic to its student workers and CHECK YOUR FOOD. 

Working for HDH is legitimately hell. All places are always understaffed, so you can have the same students opening at 6:30am or closing at 11:30pm/1:30am three to four times a week -sometimes even both in one day (it adds up). Student workers are slammed almost every shift because we are regularly scheduled shortstaffed. 

All the promises HDH says is a lie. They are not flexible at all. Sure, they will schedule you during your free hours but have fun working till 1:30am when you have an 8am the next day or working from 6:30am till 9:30am when you have a class at 10am. You only get to call off twice a quarter. If you get sick last minute but have already called off twice, you're shit out of luck and have to go in anyways unless you can get last minute coverage (and you still have to bring in a doctors note). Also, no student worker is allowed to call off work during finals week. 

Sometimes the milk that we use to make coffee is past its expiration date. There is no quality check for any food. I've seen moldy food, food with flies, etc, put on the shelf. Unless the vegetables/fruits are visibly rotting on the outside, we do not clear them out. They literally stay there until someone buys it or it rots completely. If you buy bad food, bring it back and they will refund you. Highkey I would never eat at Pines again (understaffed + high traffic = corners are being cut somewhere)

The careers, the people that work full time, create a really toxic work environment for the new hires. If any of the newbies make a mistake they'll rip them a new one. Newbies also receive like no formal training and they are just bossed around like they should already know everything.  

There is honestly a lot more than just this but overall if you are thinking about working for HDH, don't. It's not worth it, you can get a much better experience and higher paycheck elsewhere. ",,,,Thu,71.3749999999999,36.5000000000001,50.25000000000007,0.095,0.826,0.079,-0.7276,19

I think to some girls who don't talk smack its nice to be with them, and if you ever get red flags that someone is toxic, just leave. Because if they can do it to someone else, then they can/ will do it to you too. Flee before its too late.

But I've befriended someone who turned our social/friend group against me. There were red flags, but I did not isolate myself enough to brace myself for the danger. I ignored what she said about some other girls, and soon enough it happened to me. Everyone knows how she has anger issues, and low key toxic, but everyone still is great friends with her, while I'm just isolated and badmouthed, pretty much unfriended because of her. It's frustrating and hard to see people like that thrive while you're thrown down. What she did in the end was toxic and borderline bullying, but ofc, bullies never see themselves as wrong, which is the frustrating part.

So to everyone if you are sane and empathetic, every small action counts and has its consequences and merits. Don't assume things about people, or feel entitled that they should tell you personal information. Everyone has their own reasons to keep their private lives private.

So I've been proposed this definition that racism is when the majority in power discriminates the minority, which by the way is a very horrible definition but I will roll with it. And I've seen this in Berkeley where you guys straight up denied access on the road to white people thinking it's not racism because they're white and the majority. 

What you don't understand is that in Japan, we do the exact same thing. We even have a hand signal for it where we cross our arms to indicate that white people are not allowed in our restaurant, inn, taxi's or businesses. but guess what, in Japan, white people are the minority. So your definition allows it so that the exact same actions discriminating the exact same ethnicity can be done in one country and not be racist, but then can be done in another country and be hella racist. And we don't have to stop there. You honestly think that white people are the majority in Mexico, or Africa? and do you honestly believe that people in Mexico and Africa are not as hostile if not more hostile to white people than you guys who believe in this double standard racism are? Ya, the exact same thing you guys do to white people, you do it in Africa or Mexico, by that stupid definition of racism, it's racist. but for some reason, when it's in America, it's okay. 

How horrible is that? for racism to be determined by your geographic and your demographic? how horrible is that that all it takes is to change locations for an act of hate to be an acceptable act of righteousness?  

And believe me, I am no white man. and I do not for a second buy that white people have it any than a black person or a latino person. but goddamnit racism is NOT algebra. you do not just cancel out racism by being racist in the opposite direction. The way you stop racism is you stop being racist yourself, and you promote others to stop being racist. and when I say racist, I don't mean that stupid definition above with majority and privileges, I mean the REAL definition. When I say racism, I mean discriminating against anybody just because of their race and not the content of their character. That's what needs to stop. and I don't care if the person you're discriminating against is the privileged majority or the deprived minority, it is not okay. not now or ever.

How you'd like to see things fall apart, just to enjoy the damage. How you'd say the worst things to people's faces, just to watch them squirm. How you'd use the body God gave you to incite lust in men, to inspire jealousy in women; just to know that you're powerful, and you're laughing when the girls find you in the arms of their lovers.

I just want to slap every Republican in the face with this thing called ethics because yeah, if you vote for a racist, you inherently value racial equality less than whatever personal gain you'd get, which means you don't fucking prioritize racial equality and I'd say that's racist. And if you don't want more votes counted in close races, then you're saying that people's votes aren't of equal value and that is undemocratic, might as well be a dictatorship if the government can control when to stop vote tallies for them to be in their favor.

6955,2018-11-15 10:03:30,"(Excuse me for this serious, dramatic post but writing this here may be the best way for me to cope with a complicated situation I'm going through right now)

I was born with a twin brother. He passed away when we were around 4 years old. I never asked my parents the specifics as to what had happened as I knew it was an accident and not natural. However, after work last week I drank with my mother at dinner and we had a heart to heart moment (one of those intoxicated and unfiltered ones) and my mother told me something that has been on my mind every minute since. I brought up the topic of my brother and I saw my mother's demeanor instantly shift. She looked at me and with sad eyes told me that I murdered him. She said that it seemed that I had found a way to pry open the toddler stair gate and push him down the stairs to his death.

Immediately my mother began to cry and apologize for telling me, wondering why she did and I could tell she regretted it immediately, thinking I would not be able to handle the self blame. She told me to not feel guilty, that children make mistakes. However, I felt nothing. I told her it was fine, that I was happy she told me what had happened- and that we don't need to speak of it again.

The thing is, why this has been on my mind, is because I have conscious memory of my brother. Although it is distorted and the memories of a 4 year old are not to be taken as accurate- I do remember him. I remember his face and albeit our young age, a 4 year old does have significant cognition. I do not remember killing him though. I do not even remember the grief my parents had when finding his body. I only remember a few of the days following.

What is keeping me up at night is that I do not feel self blame or grief, learning that I am responsible for his death. My friends tell me I shouldn't as I was young and naturally irresponsible. However I disagree. I am sure, although I have no recollection, that it was a conscious decision in the moment. Those toddler staircase gates are not easy to open nor is it easy to push a toddler (as a toddler yourself) down a flight of stairs. Furthermore, I am concerned because I feel nothing. No guilt, no sadness, but I feel a strange combination of relief and fear. I am relieved of the questions surrounding what happened to him but now I am fearful of losing control again- should the circumstance arise.

Now I am double majoring international business and psychology, they told me that I would not survive once I graduated since my majors are just not ""specialized"" or ""expertised"" enough. Also, since I am Asian, they told me I would not be better than a white person because I'm not creative enough or I do not understand American culture.
I mean wtf. Didn't I already prove my family wrong multiple times when I can speak fluent English and got into UCSD? I just hate how Asian parents always say bad things about children and make them feel so bad about themselves.

I was out of school for a whole week and the school district was scared that the schools were going to burn down. SDGE got into hella hot water because an investigation was done and it turns out that they weren’t really taking care of the power lines. Now I feel like SDGE is overcompensating and trying to make themselves look better. My siblings don’t have school tomorrow because SDGE shut off the power to some of the county. Here’s a news video for those really interested: https://www.kusi.com/sdge-shuts-off-power-to-north-county-homes/ 

I’m really upset about this and I’m not really sure why. Like I get what areas they turned the power off too, it’s mostly in the high risk low population density areas. I think it’s just a reminder that SDGE has liberty to completely crash life, I know the people in the video are saying it’s just an inconvenience and it’s better than a fire, which it is. I know last year there was a fire really close to my house and my dad was chilling at home (he was worried about looters + wanted to defend the house). SDGE left the power on. Like why do this now when there’s no fire but leave it on when there is a fire. I guess the other thing that bothers me is that this kind of shows that SDGE can turn off the power whenever they feel like it and there’s not really anything we can do about it.

I gain/lose weight constantly, either sleep too much/too little, can’t focus, and I just generally feel worn out all the time. I joined a sport this year because I’m athletic and missed being competitive on a team but I just don’t enjoy it anymore and I feel more stressed about acting like I still enjoy it.

I’m leaning toward wanting medication or something but the thought of asking a doctor for that is so overwhelming I don’t know where to start or like if I even need it. Recently I changed my doctor to get help for some stomach issues (ulcers), and the new doctor asked if I had a history with these problems and I actually said yes. I’m going in for a follow up soon and I really want to articulate how I really feel, but when I’m in those types of situations (even in therapy) where I have to describe out loud what I struggle with I get so stuck and compensate for my problems. My parents tell me to get over the stuff I’ve hinted at to them because it’s just me vs my mind but I’m at an end where I’m just so exhausted and overwhelmed and not myself anymore that it’s hard to get over it by just thinking through it like I might have been able to do in the past.
