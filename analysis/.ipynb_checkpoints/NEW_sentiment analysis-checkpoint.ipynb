If I never went through the struggles with you, I would still be walking around in my veil of ignorance and selfishness, wondering why I am so unhappy all the time.

True, we may not see each other again in the near future. \n",

      "9 @14224 I don't know your exact situation, but having an honest talk with your parents might help. you have two ways of going about this. one, you can keep trying to delay it until you find someone on your own. this would be finding reasons to say no to the dudes/girls they get you to meet. these reasons can be as simple as not getting along with them. or you can try to possibly meet up with whoever and take it as a date set up by your parents. it helps to have someone else in your family to talk to them about it whether it be a cousin or an older sibling. either way, know you're not alone in this situation. I wish you the best of luck \n",
      "10 I was academically disqualified from UCSD during my junior year,  and I’m struggling to cope with my mental health at this time. I lost the love of my life, telling her I was breaking up with her because I wasn’t there for her 100% of the time. I regret my decision, but she understandably ignores me. I hate my current job, I hate that I fell for someone while in a relationship, I hate that I’ve fucked up so hard in just one year. I wish I could get you back, babe, but I know I broke your heart. Maybe I’m not meant to be on this Earth; maybe me being born was a mistake. I don’t deserve to be here, I’ve done nothing but fuck up the opportunities I had entered UCSD with. I hope you’re able to move on and find yourself a better life. The past 4 years have been absolutely amazing with you. If I could go back in time, I would 100% ask you out again. I don’t know how much longer I can take this, but I hope I don’t do anything stupid tonight. \n",

I was forced to pick my major at the age of 13 by my college counselor, from a very short list generated by a stupid aptitude test that I took when I was like 12. I’ve already put almost half my life into this. But I have to get my degree, I owe it to myself and my dad. I want to be an actress. It’s something I’ve always dreamed of, but I wonder if that is a really naive dream to have, because people always tell me that fame and wealth aren’t what they’re cut out to be. But what if they are? I’m too scared to pursue it for real. The reason I chose engineering is to avoid ever becoming a struggling artist. If I move to LA, I don’t think my boyfriend is going to come with me. He has his own reasons, which I respect. We can’t do long distance. I’m just wondering if a mere prospect of realizing a dream is worth throwing away my very real, wonderful relationship for. Right now it doesn’t seem like it. \n",

I can't call/text him in front of her, I can't spend the night without her spamming my phone, I can't go on a trip with him without my friends faking it for me, I can't share our cute photos on Instagram, I can't mention his name even though I have other friends with the same name. I only get to meet him on average maybe like 10 times a year, maybe less. I love my mom and I don't want to trade her life for a dude (yes it's that serious) but I love him too. I don't know what to do and it's frustrating. \"Oh just have them talk it out I'm sure she'll undertsand your love.\" Yeah no, last time I \"talked it out,\" my mom cursed me, saying I will fail all my classes and never get a job. And she almost ditched the whole family, leaving my helpless younger sister all alone and putting my dad in a really difficult spot.

I dont think shes unattractive or anything (for the most part people will probably find her cute), but for some reason I'm just not physically attracted to her. I was attracted to her personality and I thought that was enough for our relationship. However, the longer we are together the more it lingers on my mind and the heavier it heighs on my decision whether I should still stay with her or not. I've also noticed that I check out other girls more and more now and I feel just absolute trash because of it. I think that I love her but I just dont know anymore. \n",

I don't have a strong background in the stuff I'm learning because I learned only the basics of it during high school, and UCSD doesn't offer an undergrad class on it. My mentor encourages me to ask questions but I kind of feel that they're not the best at explaining theories behind certain things; kind of like the TAs who are smart and friendly, but aren't the best at explaining things to you. I'm finding myself in a spiral in which I get anxious about not knowing the theories and concepts in lab, which produce even more anxiety about other stuff such as making silly mistakes in lab, and that getting worse, on and on. Oftentimes I'm so lost I don't know where to start when asking things, which make me feel very awkward talking to my mentor. I do have other resources like asking other grad students in my lab or googling/looking at Youtube videos on certain topics. I definitely use the Internet often to learn more about something, but I feel that it's not enough. I do talk to the other graduate students, but since they're not specifically mentoring me, I feel a little limited. \n",

Right now, I've got a guy calling me a pathetic cow and threatening to suffocate/beat me, but it's because he knows I'm into it.

I've had successful relationships before college where the guys respected that and were willing to wait but everyone I've met at this school tells me that they don't want to date me bc I want to abstain. Does anyone else share the same ideologies as me and has had a successful college relationship without sex or am I asking too much of these guys by abstaining? Also this has happened with at least 7 guys at this school so now I'm starting to think that I'll just start having sex with them even if it goes against my values since no one is fond of my beliefs.\n",

I am the type of person that can easily get along with most people I meet, but the depth of my relationship with people often goes only up to the acquaintance level. I can be a part of many different groups of people but I struggle with feeling like I’m on the periphery looking in to a core group of friends who are much closer together with each other than I am with them and I don’t fit in as much as they do in that group. I felt this with my suitemates last year and with the people I have met in different orgs. I want to go out and meet new people and find the people I truly can connect with, but it feels so intimidating when most people already have a core friend group of their own that they developed, where I’ll just be an outsider on the periphery of a group again. \n",

I don’t have a problem with most of the girls and my sorority functions very well, but I’m just SO over the whole Greek life scene. I’m starting to see it more for what it really is and although the community does a lot of good, it resembles a bunch of high school type cliques and people obsessed with partying all the time. I’m over it and I find myself clicking better with people in another org I’m in. \n",

      "I might be in love with someone, or almost in love at any rate. I think it might also just be a hunger to have someone that I could love and be loved by. It’s an ache, but also almost comforting. I got a little taste of what it could have been if things had gone differently, and that certainly intensified things. And I know I could still maybe take that path, but it wouldn’t be right. You can’t make other people love you when you know that you can’t give them what they really need. I’m a fucking mess, after all. Closeted, tired, anxious, ill, afraid.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, I don’t want to be a consolation prize, and deep down, with that particular person, it would always be that way in my own eyes. Essentially, I’m only a placeholder, a poor substitute, a seemingly nearby convenience– even though being in their arms felt so right, it would be so very wrong because I wouldn’t be what she really wants in the first place. She once said a long time ago that she had thought she liked me, but then realized it was just proximity. If they had wanted me, it would have happened by now. Besides, I don’t want to stick around my hometown. I need to move on and out, or else I’ll just suffocate willingly in my own dead air.  \n",
      "\n",
      "And yet if she ever calls, I’m there. I know I would do anything in my power for her. I am loyal to those I care about, basically to a fault. For someone who wants to escape life, I almost always stick around. \n",
      "\n",
      "Then again, I’m human. And that means wanting disparate and entirely non-simultaneous things, the existence of the cake in conjunction with its absence. I love her. But I also don’t. I want her to love me back, but I also want nothing to do with that aspect of our relationship whatsoever. I want to stay close by, but I also want to be as far away as possible from the life I have lived for the past twenty years. I don’t want to be me anymore, whatever that means. I don’t want to be the person she knows anymore, and I will never probably be the person she thinks I am, although she’s probably closer to the truth than anyone else is. \n",
      "\n",
      "It is reminiscent of how I feel when I want to kill myself. I want to die, to escape, to be free, to feel nothing ever again, to feel everything at once and then let it go. I also want to live– so I can escape, and feel positive things, and be free, free, free and actually enjoy living my life. Hard to enjoy freedom when dead. It’s also hard to find love and love someone while simultaneously disavowing those emotions.  \n",
      "\n",
      "She kind of admitted to loving me, but not exactly. She referenced queerplatonic love, a relationship that goes beyond friendship but is not romantic. I kind of admitted the same thing, but then I pretended to misunderstand– to think it just meant friendship when I know it doesn’t. But I couldn’t admit how real it is to me, and how much further I have fallen than she realizes when I know that isn’t what she wants. We agreed that we were better as friends. I honestly believe that, but I wish I didn’t. I don’t want to believe that– and I can’t fully believe it either. Disparity strikes again.  \n",
      "\n",
      "I think she might feel something for me, perhaps more than she did in the past. She keeps me close enough, or at least the memories of me now that I have moved away. I’m the only person whose photograph is by her bedside. Her touches linger a bit more than they used to, especially after that particular conversation on what we have, what we are, what we might have been. But I’m going to close my eyes and ignore what I see, and I know she will do the same. We’re far too similar, after all. \n",

I was lying down on my sofa, we were kind of just talking, we got drowsy, and she laid down by me, and tension started to build.

And even worse, I don't know if I have it in me to tell her that I'm not in a great place right now. As great as the sex was, I'd feel guilty to burden her with my issues. Or should I just go for it and work things out as they come?\n",

I do fine once I'm in a relationship, it's just so  off putting when some explicitly begins an interaction (like a first date) with a mention that they're not looking for something casual. I appreciate the transparency and the honesty is nice, but there's something about it that makes me uncomfortable. I think it's the high expectations? I immediately want to date someone else. But then when someone wants something casual, then I start thinking they're relationship material.  \n",

So I don’t know how to do this, any advice?

My mom has also severely emotionally and mentally abused me growing up, and continues to do so sometimes until this day. She also shows obvious favoritism to my little sister. The details of that would be another post, but let’s just say she sees herself in my sister, thus tries to live through her, giving my sister a more loving upbringing, while I was always shut down and villianized.

How is that fair to judge a girl based on the number of people she slept with? If you’re being safe about it, why does it matter? I know I would be a high-quality gf when the time comes, and I would hate if a guy didn’t see me that way solely due to the fact that I’m “easier” sometimes.

Context: I did Varsity Sports all four years, clubs on campus, and graduated in the top of my class. The wise people in my life said that guys were intimidated by me and would have the balls to ask me out in college. Well now college. The fundamental question everyone asks...”What’s your major?” . My response: Electrical Engineering. Every time I was in an encounter with a guy and this question comes up , the knee jerk reaction is gasp and wide eyes and a step taken back. I thought oh it’s just the person, but no it has happened in every encounter I have ever had. Guys have flirted with me and complimented me and given me “the stare”. Ladies you know the one. Anyway, the real question is when do guys actually grow balls and are not intimated by a real,independent woman with a brain? Is it only when they think they will be too old to be a dad and then settle for less? \n",

All of a sudden, most of them just stopped talking to me period. Like straight up ignored. And on top of that they started accusing me of random shit that I didn't do like stealing shit from them, shitting in the showers, peeing on the walls and floors of the bathroom, and other bullshit. Next year when I'm living in Marshall Uppers I'm gonna have such a nice time while these motherfuckers stay in Marshall Lower. Makes sense why they're in the lowers because they're degenerates straight from the dumpsters. God damn they're so trash. The bright side is that for the rest of the week (today is Wednesday when I'm writing this), most of them have already moved out, so I don't have to deal with as much bullshit.\n",
      "232  In my final quarter here,  I have developed feelings for a good friend. They had been an acquaintance of mine in the past and I always thought they were cool. However, I had assumed they had no interest in talking to me beyond pleasantries. \n",
      "\n",
      "Eventually, we started running in the same circles and started talking to each other a lot. As it turns out, our personalities overlap quite a bit and we have a lot of common interests/viewpoints. I feel comfortable being myself around them, even though I still second guess every utterance or mannerism in their presence. They know that I deal with some stuff, but they are sensitive to it without being patronizing. I actually feel, kind of, happy when I’m around them and appreciate the friendship dynamic we have. This is part of why I am conflicted about having feelings for them and am afraid of being more upfront, even with graduation on the way. I don’t get the sense that it would be a huge surprise to them, it’s just that I am not one to make moves and shyness is one of my defining outward traits. We are comfortable being vulnerable with each other and I worry that they’ll feel I was being insincere if I make my feelings more apparent. Wasn’t intending to fall for anyone in my final quarter, so yep, this is difficult. If they decide they don’t want to be friends, I’ll get over it in a few weeks/months, but I am not sure if I want to deal with that pain right now on top of everything else.\n",

These things come out of nowhere and things will get really bad really soon and nobody will be ready for it. Its already starting and nobody seems to notice. Before we know it countries will run out of water and begin to wage war.

His reason, as to why he barely had time to text/call his girlfriend (me) was because his dad was in the hospital after having a heart attack and needed to stay because he had some heart issues, then in December he texted me that his dad died, his sister was suicidal, and he's a mess and has been missing uni. Then the following two weeks, he came online again (in December), I broke up with him.. Afterwards, he would be online a ton, he found his comfort talking to my friends. I missed him, so I asked him to come back.. but then my doubts bothered me even more. So, I broke up with him on January 13th and went offline social media until I felt okay. \n",

I started to binge eat and gave up on working out (because in my head, I thought what if he texts me and I'm busy.. I need to talk to him when he's online), so I basically gave up my reality waiting for him you can say. (Wow, my life actually sounds so sad while writing this out).

It just sucks bc I did this to prioritize myself and work on my own needs, but it’s helping me see all the positives from the relationship that I’m going to miss, and ofc it’s still gonna affect me.

Even though she’s a friend, I felt like she was the love of my life since I’ve went a lot further with her than I did with all my other exes. However now she isn’t really keeping me in contact that much. I have messages from many weeks ago that she hasn’t replied to. Even snaps that are still delivered. She would occasionally message or snap me some things. On my birthday she was the first one to wish me. But nowadays she barely keeps me in contact. The whole reason she said she wasn’t replying one time was that she’s going through stress and she wasn’t on her phone at all. But I keep seeing her active on Twitter and other social media. I’ve given her space especially during her finals weeks but now she’s out but still not responsive. She even hasn’t been replying to more urgent things such as when I went to the ER once or needed her help on something. We had thought of many summer plans together but now she doesn’t even talk about anything at all. I have a feeling that she no longer wants to spend time with me or is trying to cut me off. We never left off on a bad foot and she’s the type of person to call me out if I do anything wrong especially if it hurts her. I’m just a lil sad and lost. A part of me wants to get over this sadness and confusion and a part of me still loves her. I love her and I’ll never forget our memories we had. What should I do? I plan on asking her about what’s going on for closure. I understand that people get busy but no one gets busy to the point where they forget or completely cut out a good friend\n",

      "425 My “I’m graduating- fuck it” moment: one steamy long winter night ago, I ( a female humanities undergrad) was staying with friends at a cabin in Lake Tahoe. I found myself naked soaking in a hot tub sandwiched between two naked sexy STEM TAs while the snow fell as if we were in a snow globe. We had been drinking mulled wine. They were stoned. One kissed my lips while the other sucked on my nipples-unprompted by me, but my inner fuckboi could not be compelled to stop it either. One of the TA's grabbed the other’s cock and my- well you know. As my threesome with two hot men fantasy started to effortlessly unfold before me, in a winter wonderland nonetheless, I moaned loudly. Wisely, the older single TA put a break on the action and we ended the night by just chilling and staring at the steam from the jacuzzi floating into the starry night sky. The younger taken TA slinked off to bed, the older single TA and I crashed on the couch downstairs together. However, the taken TA’s gf had heard my moaning the night before. We all pretended nothing happened the next day and basically from then on, even his gf. We’re all still friends. I feel bad for not saying no to the double trouble, but despite our less than angelic behavior, it all worked out. As I reflect on this memory-boba in hand, I realize this was the closest I ever came to taking a UCSD STEM class.\n",

Him and I were friends for a long time before we got together and that was a much wilder time for me. I have never let this affect my studies. I am in no way in need of an intervention or out of control. He said he doesn’t want someone who values partying. I don’t value but yes I do enjoy it. I love going to parties with my friends and dancing with them. It’s so much fun. But I also value him and us. He’s made me happier than anyone ever has. This past year together, I’ve felt more happiness than I ever thought was possible. I love him with all of my heart. We spend time together. More than I have with anyone this year. Literally last week was the first time I got dinner with my best friend in a whole year. He says I get happier about partying than I do about us. That is absolutely not true. He asked me to give it up for a while until he felt better. He was traveling for 3 weeks and he told me to give it up while he was away. I didn’t understand his point. He was away, so I couldn’t use that time to work on our relationship. I would have to sit at home while my friends were out. It didn’t make sense to me. He got very upset when I questioned it. He said he’s very hurt. To the point where he can’t sleep at night bc he’s thinking of us. I feel horrible. I feel so guilty for the pain I’m causing him. I just don’t understand. I really do my best to be an amazing girlfriend to him. He has listed every reason he’s hurt. Ways that I haven’t done more for him when he has for me. But I do things for him too. I just show it in different ways. Idk. He’s said so many harsh things. I don’t know what to do anymore. I’m hurt too. None of my friends support us anymore. I feel very isolated. We have taken some time apart and aren’t speaking. He’s been my best friend this year. It’s been so rough. I miss him everyday but at the same time I can’t talk to him bc all we do is fight. We don’t see eye to eye. I don’t think the partying thing is the root of the problem but he won’t ever admit that. I don’t know if he knows what the real problem is. I love him a lot. Idk what to do.

      "A couple of weeks ago, I decided to (more-or-less permanently) leave an org I was in, the first one I had ever joined.\n",
      "\n",
      "Back in September, I made the decision to join this org over Intergenerational Connections because it fit into my schedule (anyone reading this who is in Intergenerational Connections, let me say that I look forward to being a part of your org fall of next year). I attended their informational session and was struck by how much the org’s work aligned with my personal interests. I was also struck by how everyone made me feel so welcome and at home. They were a very charismatic and warm-hearted bunch of people. I committed myself to the org and began to attend their meetings regularly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before we go further, allow me to make one clarification. While, the org did have a formal hierarchical structure with a club president and her vice-presidents and director generals and so on, it was de facto led  by two people (as in they did the visible day-to-day running of the org) whom I will henceforth refer to as ‘J’ and ‘S’ (for ‘Junior’ and ‘Senior’; they held the same position in the org’s leadership, but one was the senior partner and one was the less-experienced junior partner), along with their associates (all of whom are VERY close friends with one another). S was away on business across the country for fall quarter but returned in January. Hence, for all of fall quarter, J ran the show alongside the org’s de jure leadership.  \n",
      "\n",
      "My first quarter in the org were my happiest times there. We were taught the basic functions of the org and got together for some socials. My relationship with the org’s leadership was also quite positive during this time. When I injured myself and wasn’t able to attend org meetings for a couple of weeks, I emailed J telling her what had happened and she responded by saying that she totally understood and that I’m welcome back whenever I recover. A couple of weeks later, she spontaneously emailed me again checking in on my progress and to see how I was recovering. I was truly touched by the care and sincerity she showed me. After my first meeting following my recovery, I explicitly told her in person that and expressed my appreciation to her. She stated that she and S worked hard over the previous year to make the org more inclusive and less “elitist” by interacting more with all org members, new and old. At the end-of-year social we had a week or so later, she hugged me before I left and said to me “I’m so glad that you’re back with all of us”. I was, again, touched by her remarks. \n",
      "\n",
      "Then winter quarter came and that’s when things began to go pear-shaped. S returned from her business away from UCSD and she properly introduced herself to the lot of us at the first meeting of the quarter. Then J, a couple of other new org members, and I went away to attend a work function for a couple of days. During our time away, I felt that J was becoming increasingly tense and distant around me. When we returned, I asked her (through Messenger) if something was wrong (with the intent to repair any damage there may be between us). She replied with a very lengthy text that essentially accused me of disrespecting her leadership and S (for reasons unbeknownst to me; she didn’t attend the work function with us) as well as of being sexist, without providing a shred of justification for either claim. \n",
      "\n",
      "I was absolutely speechless. I had no clue what she was talking about. I always ALWAYS make sure to treat everybody, irrespective of sex, with respect and dignity. I always make sure to treat my superiors with the appropriate level of respect as well. I replayed the entire time we were at the work function and could not think of one instance where I had treated her with anything less than absolute respect. I asked people close to me, people who I know would not lie to me and would give me the honest truth, if I was sexist. The result was a resounding and unanimous ‘No’.\n",
      "\n",
      "Being accused point-blank of such terrible things infuriated me to no end. It hurt me deeply, and I felt as if I had been betrayed. I thought about asking her to justify why she felt the way she did and trying to see if we could work it out, but then concluded that any attempt to talk to someone who’d so easily accuse another person of such horrible things would bear no fruit and that I’d just be wasting my time by trying to reason with her. Should I have attempted to talk to her? In retrospect, perhaps, but in all honesty, I didn’t feel the need or desire to have to negotiate with someone like that, nor do I now. I, and a couple of my friends, came to the conclusion that her lashing out at me as she did was the manifestation of some massive insecurity she felt as a result of struggles in her personal life (that she had detailed to us at one of our socials) as well as that outing being the first outing where she’s led the team without the help of other org leaders or the guidance of S. \n",
      "\n",
      "From that day on, I’ve spoken less than 15 words to J. I simply refuse to even talk to people with that kind of mentality. They’re not worth my time and energy.\n",
      "\n",
      "My experience with the org only declined from there on out. I slowly came to the realization that I couldn’t commit nearly as much time to it as they would like me to commit and consequently, chose not to go on anymore work outings with them. My relationship with the org leadership also slowly dissipated. Socials stopped being as fun as they used to be. They mostly consisted of all the senior org people (J and S included) and their close friends who used to be in the org clumped together in one area and then all of the new people in another, shut out from the former group and forced to conserve amongst themselves. The synergy and commingling between old and new members that existed in the fall was well and truly dead. At this point, I understood that the elitism J said her and S had worked to dismantle hadn’t gone away at all. They had simply supplanted the old order with their new order. They became the very thing they swore to destroy. (Any nerds out there? ;)) \n",
      "\n",
      "I think I have made my case for my disappointment with J’s lack of leadership skills (or people skills for that matter) quite evident already. I had hoped that with S’s return, the org would become more united than ever before. She is, from what I could tell, a strong and determined and caring person. She told us at the first meeting after she returned that she cared for each and every one of us and that she looked forward to getting to know us better over the course of the year. Despite this promising beginning, however, her leadership left much to be desired. Indeed, the rest of the org’s leadership left much to be desired. They claim that they’re committed to unifying all of us and getting to know us as individuals, yet their actions don’t reflect those words. They, without fail, chose to not blend with the new members whenever the opportunity presented itself. They subconsciously excluded all of us from their circle and consequently established an elitist hierarchy of sorts within the org where there was a small privileged group at the top and everyone else at the bottom, and there is apparently no opportunity for upward mobility. No chance of fraternizing or building bonds with the senior members of our org.  \n",
      "\n",
      "In essence, their hearts seemed to be in the right place, but their actions did not reflect their verbal commitments. They didn’t try, in my mind, anywhere near hard enough to reach out to us and get to know us. They could have and should have done better (even when taking into account their busy academic lives and their personal lives as well).\n",
      "\n",
      "So, for these reasons, as well as for the reason of me not clicking with a majority of the people in the org old and new (which is perfectly fine and natural), I decided to leave the org. I would have left in early February if it wasn’t for personal reasons and commitments that obligated me to stay until early May. \n",
      "\n",
      "I suppose my departure is a bittersweet experience for me. Bitter because of all the resentment and disappointment that has stemmed from this experience. Sweet because I finally did leave, and at least now I know what it’s like to be in that org.\n",

No one said “I love you” to me because my appearance is not attractive. Also, since I am a programmer now, no one cares about those “useless” skills. I feel that I am so ordinary and negligible in this universe that there is no reason for me to exist. Dramatically, I fell in love with my high school teacher 6 months ago. She is my first love. I finally find a reason to live for. Even though she is 10 years older than me, even though we both are girls, even though we are not living in the same place, I hope one day I can live with her. I work over 10 hours each week and take 5 courses this quarter. I want to collect money to go to her city and graduate earlier. However, my temper changes drastically because of my major depression and I got an eating disorder after I restrict my diet to lose weight for 3 months. During depression episode, I cannot control to hit myself and keep asking her why you love a trash like me, which hurts her heart. She tried to save me and bring me happiness but failed. Finally, she felt tired and thus left me. Now I am alone again. I feel that because I am disabled I won’t have a normal life like others and I don’t think I will become better anymore. I care about my parents so I won’t end my life. But there’s also no reason for me to stay alive. I decided to hide those “talents” and at the same time my disabilities.

So far I've had 2 relapses this week... Right now I can't find the courage to message you because I am terrified of not knowing how you will respond to me... After I got off work today, I couldn't help but think of how badly I wanted to text you and knowing that I couldn't made me feel more sad... I always wonder how you are doing and how well you are moving on after breaking up with me and wonder how many times I pop into your mind and how many times you thought of all the amazing memories we shared together... I don't care about how it's best that I wait for you to text me back first, but I miss it all no matter how many times people tell me to move on... I've been told to move on so many times even though it's only been a few weeks, but I cannot just drop everything in a heartbeat because it all means a lot to me; YOU mean a lot to me still... No matter how many times you tell me you're not sure, I still want to be with you... I miss looking forward to seeing you each week and visiting you and your family and going to church with you all even if I can't understand what they're saying... All the good things I did were for you, because I really did care and do care for you now... I wish you could have accepted me at my worst... I wish you would accept my calls and let me talk to you because I am genuinely trying to change for you and hopefully prove to you that I can change.. I don't know the real meaning behind the words you tell me, but I can only take them how I read it and believe what you tell me... I love you so much, and I haven't shown it that well before we broke up, but if I didn't then I wouldn't have dedicated so much time to you and visit you... You were my priority, and I even cared about you more than I cared about myself sometimes...

      "500 Anyone here’s that’s in Psych 148 this quarter ? I really want to say these in class today but didn’t get a chance, since the “debate” was going so crazy between a few individuals.  Honestly this is not the most interesting class out there, and the instructor is not the best lecturer either. But some of you in that class gotta stop disrupting the instructor, just let he teach please🙄🙄 For example, today the lecturer was talking about something about heuristics and used a depression questionnaire as an example. First question on the questionnaire was something like, “did you cry in the last week” or something, if you answered no, according to the questionnaire you do not have clinical depression. Like hey, the instructor was just using it as an example, it’s a class of making judgements and decisions, it’s not Psyc100. I agree that maybe the instructor could use a better an example, but there was definitely no need to argue with the instructor for 10+ or even 20 minutes (a 50 minute class) on how this questionnaire is wrong and not reliable and will not be a good questionnaire.  Especially the girl sitting at the front row, who claimed that she has clinical depression, and that this specific questionnaire will not properly diagnose her situation.

When I began attending UCSD, I developed an anxiety disorder where the worry and stress of doing well overcomes my mental/ emotional state where I barely function. This resulted in missing quizzes and assignments because of unforeseen panic attacks. I asked my professor for empathy but he didn’t have any. I don’t wish to disclose my illness to my professor because I feel very uncomfortable due to how personal it is. I feel like I’m failing my classes and I don’t know what to do :(  Any tips on not failing??\n",

      "527 I sense that a number of people in this group want to move the community away from Facebook out of (understandable) fears of this new page getting zucced again and/or out of the belief that the new confessions are bland and boring. I personally don’t see how these confessions are dull, nor do I know what the hell these people are looking for in these posts (whatever the fuck this “spice” they talk about refers to). In fact, I think they’re as good as the old ones on 3.0 near its demise (if not better, since they’re now curated for quality). \n",
      "\n",
      "If we move away from Facebook, the whole community will suffer. There isn’t a shred of doubt in my mind about that. Most people aren’t going to go with the dedicated confessions webpage and then regularly check it for new posts. \n",
      "\n",
      "A big reason for this community’s success (as well as the original page which I wasn’t a part of and 3.0 along with similar ones at Berkeley and Irvine) is primarily because it is on Facebook. An ungodly number of people on this campus use Facebook to some extent or another, and thus, it is easy for us to keep up with the page and offer advice and insight and GIFs and whatnot in response to posts on it. It is also easy for new people to join and contribute, since they did not need to go to a separate website and make a new account to comment. It also makes the pages quite visible and easy to find, which also makes it easy for us to increase membership size. If this community wasn’t on Facebook, I probably would have never found out about it and my life would’ve been less colorful as a result.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moving away from Facebook simply inexplicable in my view. It is utterly irrational and indefensible. Simply put, it would be the end of this community as we know it if we abandon Facebook, and I promise you, nothing will ever be the same again.\n",
      "\n",
      "I fuckin’ love this page and this group of people and I love how we now have a space where we can vent and express ourselves and ask for/get help without shame or fear. It’s help me plenty (as well as allowed me to give aid and comfort to others in need), and I’m sure it’s helped plenty of others too. I love all of the love and respect and camaraderie we have with one another. It’d be a real goddamn shame if it were to suddenly go away.\n",
      "\n",
      "How about this? If you want “spice” in the community so bad, how about we adopt the idea put forth by #13743. The admins can create a separate webpage (they said they were thinking about). But instead of shifting our operations unto that new page and just putting highlights from that page on the Facebook page, we keep Facebook as our main base of operations and simply put highlights and submissions that could potentially violate Facebook’s rules (which I assume are the “spicy” confessions) on that page. In essence, have the separate confessions webpage serve as a complement to the main Facebook page and help it avoid getting zucced again. \n",
      "\n",
      "Also, implement the separate Google Form for complaints about posts and comments that are deemed offensive or inflammatory or in poor taste or whatever and then ADVERTISE THE SHIT out of that form to ensure that old members and new members alike know where to go when they want to report something. If Berkeley and Irvine can manage to keep their respective communities thriving with these structures and (I think) more draconian rules and restrictions than we have, why the fuck wouldn’t we be able to keep 4.0 afloat with these two measures?\n",

      "So, after two weeks of mulling over what I could have done differently, I personally felt that I wasn’t dealt a very good hand of cards to start with. I fell for a lady who was a year ahead of myself and graduating in 2 quarters (whilst I still had 8 to go), who held a leadership position in the org I was in, and supremely busy (and thus really difficult to talk to). I couldn’t get over the fact that she was (in the context of the org) my superior and thus I stopped myself from proactively trying to get to know her better and getting closer to her. I couldn’t get over the personal belief of how it is supremely inappropriate to develop feelings of romance for your higher-ups and that you ought to maintain a courteous, professional, and somewhat distanced relationship with them (a product of my upbringing). \n",
      "\n",
      "The person who responded to my original confession on 3.0 stated that I didn’t really know her for who she was and that I just had a severe case of infatuation. Perhaps, but I like to think I was able to cobble together a rough sketch of who she truly was based on what she’s shared with us (the org) and what I’ve heard from others and then made an informed decision to go after her based on that sketch. She was a very strong woman who knew what she wanted from life and refused to take shit from anyone else yet immensely caring and compassionate. She looked out for the well-being of everyone in our org (it’s fairly small) and knew its quirks like the back of her hand. She was immensely intelligent and a politics and military buff (specifically military strategy). In short, she possessed a number of admirable qualities and traits, qualities that I look for in a lady (and my God, was she a fine lady).\n",
      "\n",
      "Thinking back, I realize that even if she had been single and I had been more assertive, we probably would’ve ended up getting together sometime in late February or early March, and considering that she’s graduating in June, I probably would’ve been dumped around this time. I don’t think 3 months or so is nearly enough time to build the necessary foundations for a lasting off-campus relationship. And while I believe in Lord Tennyson’s words, “Tis better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all”, I think the devastation would have been far worse had this been the case. Also, I think it’s safe to assume that she’s probably been dating this person she’s with for a fair while (most likely even before she returned from her business across the country in January).\n",

      "The only way I could’ve gotten with her, realistically, was if I joined the org with her last year, which is a preposterous hypothetical. A) As a newbie freshman, I wasn’t ready to immerse myself into clubs yet. B) I wasn’t even sure I was going to join that org until earlier this year; and that’s only because it fit into my schedule. And C) I mean, how could I have known at the time that if I joined that org, I’d meet and fall for a very lovely single lady with whom I shared similar interests?\n",

It’s just they’re scattered all over campus in different lecture halls and colleges and orgs and I haven’t had to opportunity to encounter them yet.\n",

He mentioned how bummed he was in that he was going to be wet all day since it was his long day, walking from class-to-class without cover from the hard rain. I wanted to offer my umbrella, but my OCD was very against it, as my brain goes into major germophobia-mode at the idea of someone touching my things. However, I saw a foreshadowing misery plaguing his mind. So, I told my OCD to fuck off and gave him my umbrella for the day. He was stoked he wouldn’t be wet and miserable.

Apparently all our friends who were staying in the house with us could hear it and they knew something weird was up cause I'm straight af.

I’m not saying that animal rights aren’t important because they obviously are. Some animals are treated like shit by their owners but that’s in a pet situation. You can not deny that we depend on animals such a chickens and cows to provide for the necessities of our nutrition. People will literally get mad and make it a bigger deal when animals get treated worse than human beings. Fuck off all of you who think like that. How can you put the life of an animal over a human. People are so sensitive these days they want to protect everything and get offended by everything. I am pretty liberal myself. I support gay marriage and gender equality and support to immigrants who need it. I am a male by the way. But I will not stand for people caring over animals more than humans. You fake asses need to wake up and get a fucken intervention. The life of an actual human is way more important than that of animal that probably won’t make it past 10 years. This is especially important when it comes to babies. Babies are a gift to us and a mother’s greatest achievement \n",

There seems to be an increase in the vegan population as a whole, and many people are also trying to cut down on their consumption of animal products for a large variety of reasons, so it would make sense to provide more options. Also it's frustrating that there is only one dish on campus that I truly enjoy, and SOMETIMES I JUST WANT A NICE MILKSHAKE AND CHICK'N TENDERS WHEN MIDTERMS ARE DESTROYING ME EMOTIONALLY OKAY\n",

I don’t want either of us to feel like we were held back or wasted time in college and stuck in a state of wondering “what if...” and for those feelings to develop into resentment and possible cheating from wanting to know what’s out there.\n",

I actually don’t have any particular person in mind, just trying to be aware of what our lives look like for the next couple years and want to make sure both of us are in the best situation and mindset possible! If anyone has experience with open relationships, any advice or tips about ground rules and extent of communication?Please no comments about how we’re at a young age and we’re probably going to change and I probably won’t end up with this man anyways; I trust my gut and I know how I feel. My main goal is to make our relationship the best it can be. Thanks in advance!\n",
      "652 I’m overthinking!!! I’m really unsure as to why this is still bothering me. About a week ago I called out my boyfriend on having very sexual content on his Instagram because legit every time he’d show me something on his ig I’d see some girls who literally almost naked. I’m all about women empowerment don’t get me wrong. But I don’t feel comfortable with my boyfriend liking those kind of photos. He told me he’d unfollow the accounts and he slowly has been but I still see what he likes and it’s still the same content. I’m not sure what to do. It’s been making me feel insecure lately. Obviously the best answer is to talk to him again but I hate repeating myself more than once when it comes to expressing concerns and problems. I feel like he should take into consideration with how I feel cause I’m sure he wouldn’t like if I started to follow a bunch of men and half my feed is shirtless men with six packs and a ripped body. Should I just brush it off or wait till I see him again and ask him in person if he unfollowed those accounts? I don’t want to hear “if you’re not insecure it shouldn’t bother” type of bs - it’s uncomfortable to see your partners feed be mostly women who are naked or barely clothed majority of the time. \n",

I have yet to do anything with a girl but I am scared and I don’t think any girl would want to help me out with this.

We aren’t mind readers, and when there are 30 customers in line during a rush its really inconvenient for everyone if we have to spend time figuring out what you want if you just come up and order “a london fog and a bagel.”\n",

      "2) If you’re not paying with dining dollars and we ask if it’s going to be dining dollars, just say “no” instead of saying yes and then pulling out your credit card bc then we have to cancel and change payment method, which is inconvenient especially during a rush. And if its not dining dollars, it would be helpful if you actually said what the payment is going to be instead of having us grill you with “card? Cash? Community?”\n",

      "3) Take off your headphones/earbuds when you talk to us. Maybe then you’d actually hear what we are saying rather than just guessing. \n",

Just do us the common decency of answering the question instead of standing silently and showing us your ID. \n",

We both feel like we really like each other and although there are challenges like every other relationship, I feel like in trying to be too perfect in the relationship I have made myself uncomfortable in it. We both give each other enough space and spend time apart. Although she makes time for me I feel that her new set of friends takes away her priority to me. I'm sorry but I want a relationship were we both come first for each other and it's sad to see how I have to fight for my spot. Also as she moved away from her house, she has gotten more independence and is experiencing things she never did with me and I hate it. I try to be supportive and caring but I'm just jealous when she's hanging 24*7 with her friends (and obviously guys make me more insecure) and also when she goes on trips with them. I know it's important to understand in a long distance that her life is still to continue and expand and I try to act normal on it. But it fucking sucks, she sees right through it and it has been repeating for long and I can't hold these standards anymore. I just want to be selfish in love and even though at the bottom of my heart I know she really loves me, it's just that she has this friendly personality and gets along with guys really well.

She loved this puppy very deeply and shared a very close and loving bond with him (he gave her comfort at a time when she really needed it most, when times were really rough for her). It fuckin' crushes me on the inside to see her in such anguish as a result of what's happened to him. So, I was thinking of getting her a stuffed cuddly of her dog (same color, same breed) in order to allow her to preserve his memory as well as cheer her up (plus, she loves stuffed animals; she has a whole bunch of them of different animals as it is). I desperately want to do something that'll make her really happy as well as do something meaningful for her. She's just so incredible as a person and means so much to me. Do you guys think this is a good idea? Or should I not do it because she may be trying to put this behind her and get over him? (By the way, I'm not going to give it to her now or even in the next week, but I'll give it to her sometime in early June before we break for summer; that should give her some more time to heal and get some closure.

      "\tSo at the beginning of the school year, I came to college still kinda together with my girlfriend. We were gonna try long distance but we were gonna be far enough apart that we’d only ever be able to see each other on breaks. Things ended pretty quickly into the beginning of fall quarter, but we wanted to stay friends. But pretty much from when we broke up, she treated me terribly. She kept cancelling on plans to talk (or hang out when we were on break) and sometimes she didn’t even say she was cancelling and just went out to do something else instead. And through all of this, she still tried to tell me that she cared about me. She even bought a plane ticket to fly here and visit at the beginning of winter quarter. By the beginning of winter quarter though, I was really pissed off at all of her immature behavior and almost considered telling her not to come, but I didn’t in the end. About a week after she left SD, I decided to cut her out of my life because she was being a shitty friend, and conversations that we had when she visited really opened my eyes to some truths about her. She basically has no moral compass and wasn’t really bothered at all when one of her friends sexually assaulted someone else. She’s also extraordinarily immature and irresponsible and needs help doing the most basic tasks of living. I think cutting her out of my life was one of the best decisions I’ve ever made because there’s a lot of things that I just couldn’t see when I was in a relationship with her, but I realized that she was really abusive. She would get mad at me for not knowing exactly what she was thinking a lot. She’d also say that we should break up, and expect me to convince her that we shouldn’t if she was unhappy with me. One time, when she called me over the summer and said that she thought we should break up, I told her that if she couldn’t handle long distance then it was fine and we should. She then got really mad at me because I was supposed to tell her that we should stay together. She even brought this incident up to some of our friends as if I had done something wrong by agreeing with her. Also, she was always wanting to do sexual activities. If I didn’t want to but she did, she’d get mad at me. She basically told me that if I was attracted to her then I would want to. She didn’t ever consider that sometimes I wasn’t in the mood or I didn’t want to do certain things. In the summer before college, she kept putting a lot of pressure on me to have intercourse (an activity which I have no interest in). I tried saying no, saying that we shouldn’t do it. But she kept pressing me and would ask, “Don’t you want to?” And I wasn’t really sure how to respond ever, because if I said no, she would get mad because that would mean that “I wasn’t attracted to her.” I really didn’t want too though and my answers of “no” weren’t working and she couldn’t take the hint. Luckily I was never forced to do that with her, mostly because for the end of our relationship, I mostly just stopped doing any kind of sexual activities with her.\n",
      "There’s a part of me that doesn’t understand how I let myself be caught up in a relationship with somebody who’s so horrible (and it’s not just me, she’s lost a number of friends since starting college). On the other hand, I think I know so much more now. I know everything that I don’t want next time. And, I’m happy being single after basically being tethered to her for a year and I’ve met people who are so much better now. I guess the story has a good ending. Some of you may know who I am, some may not, but I’d like to thank everyone here who has made this year so amazing!\n",

      "907 This could be bad. I have my life together, and I'm in a great place. Except I managed to catch feels. Someone I'm pretty close with, but what's worse, this person is kind of an emotional train wreck, somewhat immature, and self-admittedly a little crazy. But I find them so interesting and fun to be around. What do I do?\n",
      "908 My roommate has been pissing me off all year (e.g. stealing my shit, hitting on my girlfriend, being an asshole towards others, denying everything he's done wrong) and I usually go workout or take a walk and complain to my best mates to blow off some steam, but yesterday was different. I fucking snapped, but suddenly kept my cool because I had an amazing stress-relieving idea. The moment he left the apartment, I jizzed all over his pillow. Not only did I feel amazing, it was a huge load.\n",

The hand marks are still there, and we were high the other day and he got paranoid thinking that they’ll stay there forever. Has anyone been through this before? Also, I can’t wait to go home and fuck my ex so he can see it. I hope he get jealous, that asshole. \n",
      "912 I went out on what I thought was a date last week, but right after we got our food, she started showing me pics of her boyfriend? I thought maybe I had mistaken our meal for something more, but it’s been a few days and we’re still talking. I’m not sure how to ask if us going out and doing things is just friendly or if she’s in an open relationship, but I’m really conflicted and still a little hurt from finding out right in the middle of dinner. She’s really nice, but I’m going to stop my feels if she’s got another man already.\n",

      "916 I've been dating this guy for a few months but I'm so emotionally stunted that I feel like I've been holding myself back from fully liking him. I think recently I've become more comfortable with my feelings but I'm scared I'll fall in too deep and end up liking him more than he does me. \n",

      "But the truth is even though I love math with all my heart and have a wonderful job as a coder, I love performing. I am a decent singer (or at least everybody around me has been kind enough to feed me that delusion.) And I love the adrenaline rush of stage fright. No rollercoaster, skydiving, horror film, or near death experience has ever given me the same thrill performing in front of an audience has given me. And I've done acting, singing, marching band and I sincerely miss that rush of everybody focusing in on me. \n",
      "\n",
      "But the reason I didn't as a student, nor will I ever chase a career or even a hobby as a performing artist is because I'm terrified of being famous. I have skeletons in my closet. I have said and done horrible things that I know for fact will not now or ever be forgiven (and on a side note, to the lgbtq and women of this world, I want you to know that i regret every single horrible thing I've said about you. I'm sorry I was a bigot. And I'm sorry I caused you pain). And just knowing that one day, I will not only fall but fall so hard that I can never have a career in arts or anywhere else when the world knows my name and my sin is a nightmare for me.\n",

Not anything like bf/gf, even just as friends because I swear every girl I've known since HS I've probably said something stupid rude or uncalled for by accident and I need advice (like making a joke about using a Snapchat filter but it turns out that's her everyday makeup or saying something incredibly retarded while complimenting her hair or something).\n",
      "\n",
      "If I say something retarded like that, how does a girl react to that so I know I'm not seen as a total creep or some weirdo because I slipped up saying what I meant as a compliment or joke?

Also it makes our shower smell like shit half the time. I'm glad I paid thousands for this shit btw. \n",
      "924 Dumped my girlfriend by pretending I'm gay (I'm openly bisexual).  In reality, she's just not cute and has a bad attitude.  It sucks that she'll think I didn't find her photos cute because I'm gay and not because they were unflattering, but I guess that's a problem for her, lol\n",
      "925 I need advice on shooting my shot in less-than-ideal conditions. There is this really beautiful girl I have been seeing near the Village. She is probably not a village resident, but I usually see her at the market. I do not want to inconvenience her by talking to her, but I want to shoot my shot before summer comes. How do I do this in the most inoffensive way possible?\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't want to approach her at night, and I don't want to annoy her while she has headphones on. I don't want to interrupt her while she is eating, and I just don't want to come off like a creep in general. But I am starting to realize that the perfect time will never come. I'm going to have to shoot my shot in one of these annoying ways. If I don't, I may never see her again. Any advice? \n",

      "928 In response to #13543 (the pee thing): I’ve been holding my pee in for sexual pleasure since I was 11. I have a hard time masturbating so this is the only way I feel anything.  Overall, this isn’t as uncommon as you think it is. Do a little scouting online and you’ll find there are other women who get pleasure from holding their pee in and/or peeing. Holding your pee in makes sense. The bladder pushed against the gspot. Be careful doing this often. You don’t want to get a UTI. Amazed I’ve never got one after all these years. \n",

I used to be very extroverted and very fun but idk what’s happening. I know people can be busy and stuff and I accept that. But when people aren’t and have time to dick around often times I’m not included. Or even when I am, I’m just awkwardly silent while trying to grasp into the conversations or activities. Often times I go to gatherings, kickbacks, or parties and I always feel like I’m left out. At times I feel like I’m always alone with no one to talk to. A part of me wants to change schools and the other half doesn’t since I’ve already spent two years here. I just want to make friends that I can be me with. So far I feel like I’m either judged, invisible, or not even cared about here. It’s so hard now since my family are back home and I haven’t seen them in ages, neither my friends back home. It’s affecting my mental state too much. God knows what I’ll do next\n",

She told me she wasn't good enough for me and she did not want me to settle for her. I told her that I  could not see her as only a friend (which is true). I told her to please look after herself and do whatever is in her power to get better mentally. She liked my answer ; we are going to get food together next week. She told me to give my flowers to my mom for raising a good son. I was holding back tears because I really do think I love this person.

You tell me to become a better person for the both of us and I am genuinely trying to do that for you... I want to show you that I can change for the better of us and somehow be able to rekindle our relationship because I care so much about you and love you more than anyone else in the world... You told me if we are meant to be together then it'll happen but believe me, I really hope it happens because I need you... You were and still are that person that I was dying to have in my life... Before you found a way into my life, I would dream of when I would finally meet someone who made me feel comfortable and loved, and that was you. The same person that I was dying to have, I was not... I never gave you the support that you gave me... Each time I was upset for whatever reason, you had the heart to look at me with the same smile I fell in love with... As I say this I could imagine you telling me that you should have had more respect for yourself and that makes my heart ache... I know we have had plenty of bad days, and believe me I know, but I wish we were able to overcome the final fight as a couple and grow stronger from it... If the roles were reversed and it were me, I would try my best to look past what happened and work it out with you... I know you have every right to be as hurt as you were because of everything that I've done to you, but what hurts me the most to this day is thinking about this one thing: Whenever I ask you why are you still with me then, you would always say because you loved me... Well I love you too and I really wished we were able to talk about everything that went wrong and learn and grow from our hardships... The amount of bad days we've had do not even compare to the good days we've had... As I work on myself, know that you are still on my mind each day, and as much as I want to text you or call you, I don't because I don't think you want to hear from me...

I noticed that there are cliques within the group and it was just hard to merge in any of those cliques.

No. I’m very happy to be alone most of the time, and I feel healthy, and I will be successful in whatever path I go.

Like, we never really saw very much of each other or interacted much with each other, yet the fact that I’ll probably never see her again somewhat depresses me.

      "Oh, completely irrelevant to the rest of this story, but it might also be of some interest and humor value to you to know that my other efforts to impress/humor/not appear ignorant in front of/humiliate myself in front of her included learning a few words in Afrikaans that are totally useless in polite conversation (well, except for “Hello” and “Goodbye”), developing my impression of a white South African (which for some reasons unknown to me had flairs of Indian in it), spending around $20 on two pounds of frozen boerewors and another $50 on South African groceries (drinks, meat pies, Nik-Naks, rusks, etc.), picking up some NorCal slang, and acquiring a metric crap-ton of waterfowl related puns, among a couple of other things. Ahh, the things I do for love.\n",

I wanted to try the dishes that aren’t that popular (at least in American culture) like bistek, tapsilog, and tinola AND THEY ARE ALL SO FUCKING GOOD. I literally have not tried a Filipino food that I didn’t like. And don’t even get me started with Filipino desserts because those are on another level of goodness.

      "1095 I'm someone who has trouble making friends and I was lucky enough to make friends with my roomates. It started off quite well, hangouts etc. I'm admit that I can be a bit dumb at times and my roommates caught on. Coming into 2nd quarter they started teasing me for it and I played it off as a joke. That's how it started off as a joke. It escalated pretty quickly where there is not a day that goes by where they didn't make fun of me. I feel like I'm middle school all over agian and it fuckin sucks. Everyone else in our friend group noticed it to and questioned them on why they are doing this. Their explanation was that \"it's just what friends do\". They even brag about it like that is how \"close\" we are because I can \"stand\" it.  Really though, I got to the point where I'm discourage to even talk to them, in fear of saying something wrong or dumb and have them just go off on me. I hate being in dorm because they're there and after they go off on me I just leave the dorm for hours and act like I'm studying. I cry here and there because of them because I just feel like I'm being bullied in fucking college like I was in throughout my childhood. The one time they caught me crying, they said \"it's just joke, why are you crying\". I'm know they good people but I wish they were more considerate. I'm scared to tell them what I feel about them, since I will probably be told that I'm to sensitive( I've always been told that) and dont know how to take a joke. I living with them next year and I dont think my mental state cant handle it anymore. I feel like I'm trapped because all of my friends are also their friends and I have no one to talk to. \n",

(For reference, I have only taken BILD 1-3, and Chem 6 series) I would be forced to take the Ochem series for engineers (aka non-bio majors) at UCLA, and ochem at UC berkeley, well gradee deflation much?

He broke up with me, hooked up with a friend he always told me not to worry about, fucked another girl the night I came back home even though we agreed to see each other when I came back. He ignored all of my texts for a month when I left to college, even though the day before he said he loved me and couldn’t wait to see me when I came back home. It’s hard bc every time I go back he’s there, so it’s hard not to text him, not to see him. I don’t even know if I want to get over him, but I know that I want to stop feeling this pain. I should stop seeing but god the sex is great and I haven’t been able to enjoy it with anyone else - and trust me, I’ve tried \n",

I don’t know what in the world is wrong with me...I’m a pretty attractive girl and I’m a huge giver in every possible way. Sometimes I wonder if my SOs only liked me for what I gave to them, how I look, how I am in bed, and how I make them feel and not for me actually being me.

      "1129 What really bothers me is how people are simply killing animals all the time. Like why? I find it so stupid how people go out killing animals when there's an animal attack. For example, we see a shark attack and then the next few years, we start going out there and hunting sharks. Sharks don't even attack humans on purpose. First of all, you're in their fucking territory and they have the right to defend themselves and home. Don't fucking expect the animals to not defend their homes when you're fucking in their territory. We fucking have the right to shoot people for being in our property like the fucking wild animals that we are but when an animal is doing the same exact thing, it's fucking like the world is going to end. Second of all, most animals are fucking curious so they \"nibble\" and sometimes it just so fucking happens that it's labelled as an \"attack\". Dogs fucking come up and sniff for curiosity or they fucking teeth and we think it's cute. Sorry sharks don't fucking come up to you and poke you with their fins as curiosity. Their way of being curious is having a nibble; they're just strong jaws. That's why people in fucking cages when shark diving get \"attacked\". Sharks don't know what the fuck is that thing doing in the water and they want to know. We are allowed to just waltz into any fucking animal territory and study their homes and behavior how ever we like because of curiosity without thinking about invading their territory. There's fucking 16 annual shark attacks and 1 fatal shark attack EVERY. TWO. FUCKING. YEARS. You have a higher chance of dying to a fucking bullet ant than a shark. What's with people killing animals and poaching?!?!? Who in the right fucking mind looks into an animals eyes and fucking start cutting their horns off? That's like having other fucking people coming up to you and taking your fucking organs and selling it for money, which is the fucking black market organ trade. That's so fucking wrong but you're doing the same exact shit to animals but because we're on the top of the food chain or we are a more advanced organism living in this fucking world, it gives us the right to fucking do that to other animals but when it's done to us, it's fucking war. Don't fucking get mad at me and say shit like \"there's people out there who do good for these animals\". Yea no shit, there's people out there but there's also fucking good cops our there but all we fucking remember is those police officers who shoot black people just because they can. It's because we're wearing a uniform that represent the human race and there's fucking a lot of people who are out there making these adorable and loving animals go extinct. This is why I wish there's more diseases like cancer and the bubonic plague to fucking kill more humans; we're over populating this fucking world anyway and killing other animals just to sustain our selfish asses. Yea, say what if my family members get cancer? Honestly, that's just how life goes and it sucks. I'm willing to exchange 2.53 billion people for all the animals that aren't SUPPOSED to go extinct and have them back. It fucking sucks thinking how there's only 2 FUCKING NORTHERN WHITE RHINOS LEFT. It fucking sucks how some of us will never know how a fucking gorilla, tigers, sea turtles, orangutans, elephants, rhinos, or even saolas look like because we're too busy fucking killing other animals to keep ourselves alive. Don't give me crap about this is just survival of the fittest. These animals belong here and they are the reason why we have life on this shitty planet. I'm tired of seeing people treating other living things like shit. I'm tired of seeing people not know what belongs in the fucking trash or recycle or compost. I'm tired of dumb-ass people who are fucking in college and still don't know how to act as a fucking decent human being. People like that are a fucking waste of space and deserve to die.

And to the counterpoint of “oh, my girl admired them too and we agree on their hotness”: these things can build up to be insecurities as well. If you’re going googly-eyed over qualities that she can’t stack up to or flat out doesn’t have and cannot achieve, she very well may be internalizing new insecurities even if she doesn’t voice em.

      "Support for Israel in the United States should not be a monolith, the current Knesset government is ripe for criticism. However, this does not mean that all criticism of Israel is fair, or even truthful. From one liberal to many, here are the checks you can go through yourself to determine whether or not you’re an antisemite when you criticize Israel.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Am I demonizing Israel in the same way Jews are demonized by open anti-semites?\n",
      "Example: instead of “The state of Israel kills Palestinian babies! They’re evil!” say “when the IDF responds with lethal force to rocks and firebombs being thrown at them in Gaza’s protests, children are often among the dead. I condemn Israel’s military for their actions but why do Palestinian protesters feel the need to bring their children to what they know will be a lethal backlash?” (Answer: Hamas pays its martyrs)\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Am I delegitimizing Israel’s right to exist, even though self-determination is the same bedrock argument for Palestinian statehood?\n",
      "Example: instead of “Israel illegally stole land given to Palestine in the UN partition plan of 1947”, say, “While Palestinian leadership at the time walked away from the 1947 plan, it is long overdue for Palestinians to be given autonomous control over the West Bank and Gaza” (as long as said control isn’t government by terrorist organization but that’s my opinion showing again)\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Am I applying a double standard to Israel that doesn’t apply to other countries?\n",
      "Example: Calling for political and systemic violence against Israel for civilian casualties during war when only 2% of the casualties from President Obama’s drone strikes in Pakistan were known military leaders, and had over a thousand civilian injuries.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Israel-Palestine conflict is one of the most difficult political topics to navigate. Both sides commit routine acts of murder because the other side won’t stop, and excessive, unchecked, improper criticism of both sides can lead to anti-semitism and islamophobia.

At this moment, Israel is the only place in tnr middle east wear Jews, Muslims, Christians and atheists can live and thrive together. At this moment if Israel's neighbors were to lay down their weapons and recognize Israel as the eternal and historical home of the Jews, where all can live free and prosper, there would be peace, but if Israel were to lay down its weapons, it would cease to exist. It is that simple.\n",

      "For the Christians that support trump, I'm a Christian, but notice far too often that the majority of my religion and pastors support trump. This is insane. He has no regard for our faith and is playing the majority of us like fools, saying stuff like \"he brought back saying Merry Christmas\" to pander to the gullible among us, which I'm realizing is far too many. Nearly all of his policies go directly against what we stand for.\n",

Would he really want us to put a wall up and stop people from coming here for a better life, or tell those fleeing dictatorships and war torn countries to go back because we, as the richest country in the world, cant help them? Would he really want us to continue to pollute and destroy the one planet he gave us when there are plenty cleaner alternatives just because some rich people's businesses would go under? If you think yes to any of these, you are utterly mistaken for what Jesus stood for. Jesus always looked out for the poor and low among us and trump would never even voluntarily say hi to a person like that unless he knew it would be caught on camera and get him a few votes. \n",

I understand the desire for a Jewish state after what occurred in WWII. I cannot comprehend how I would feel if my group of people were slaughtered the way Jewish people were. But is it wrong to criticize how the Israeli government and army runs? Palestinians have called Israel home for centuries, it does not make sense to oppress them. Innocent civilians are killed and there are tedious checkpoints, for what? How is that okay? I do not agree with the approach of the Justice for Palestinians group. The wall is aggressive and not pushing for a peaceful, respectful conversation. But I think if the Israeli government would stop placing numerous checkpoints in the West Bank, and would not go ham on Gaza whenever a few rockets fly over, and would recognize and treat Palestinians as equal citizens, maybe the situation would be better?  Thousands of Palestinians were literally forced out of their hometowns in order to help create Israel. The concept of a Jewish state is important and needed, but I think it is important to address that the way Israel functions and came about was wrong.\n",

I guess depressed might not be the right word, I just go throughout my life not really feeling anything or being excited for things or loving people or having curiosity like I used to in highschool even though life is pretty good surface-level. I guess a lot of bad personal shit happened that might have made me like this, but even then it really wasn't that bad compared to others.

I still make it to class and work, and people really can't suspect that anything is wrong with me. None of this makes any sense because I have a good life and I feel like I'm just creating problems for myself. I know I should reach out and get help but I'm so ashamed of feeling like this again. It's been years since I came out of my last bout of depression and I feel weak that I'm going through this again. I don't talk to anyone because I'd rather not burden them with problems. I sometimes wonder if I'm going to feel like this for the rest of my life. That I'm incapable of being happy. Don't get me wrong, I'm an extremely grateful person.

      "First and foremost, I definitely should have been more proactive and vigorous in my efforts to getting to know her better and building up that bridge. Secondly, I also shouldn’t have waited 22 weeks to finally pop the question.\n",

      "Truth be told, I have a rough and I think fairly accurate picture of what kind of person she is judging from what I’ve seen (in person and through our org’s group chat) and what I’ve been told by others. I didn’t mention this in my previous posts out of concerns for anonymity, but I fell for her not because she was just a very physically attractive lady (which was absolutely was), but because she was a passionate, patient, and caring soul with a big heart. She was someone who looked out for each and every one of us in the org no matter how well or little she knew us to make sure we were safe and sound (physically, mentally, and emotionally), someone who was a self-professed politics and military strategy nerd (which I find very neat, since I’m also a political/military/history buff) with a dark and sometimes morbid sense of humor (which I also really appreciate), and someone who doesn’t take shit from anyone else (which is probably the #1 reason why I fell for her; she was proud of who she was and comfortable with herself). \n",
      "\n",
      "Does all of this mean she definitely would’ve been as good as I made her out to be? No, but she certainly piqued my interest to the point where I decided it was worth a shot. I may not have a solid answer on who she was precisely, but I had a rough and solid enough sketch, and I liked what I saw. \n",
      "\n",
      "Was I aware it could’ve been a really short term relationship considering that she’s graduating in 4 weeks? Yes, but to be honest, even if we didn’t make it past June, at least it we would’ve had those couple of months with each other, a couple of months of mutual happiness and companionship, and I think that’s pretty worthwhile too. As Lord Tennyson said, “Tis better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all.” (Yeah, I admit I’m a bit of a hopeless romantic)\n",
      "\n",
      "The reason I wasn’t more proactive with her, that I didn’t take more risks and fight like hell and allowed myself to just coast was because I saw her as my boss, essentially. She was my superior in my org and where I’m from, it is absolutely inappropriate to develop romantic feelings for your higher-ups. You maintained a courteous, professional, and somewhat distanced relationship with them and that was that. I struggled to fight this mindset throughout the five months we had known each other. I couldn’t convince myself that she wouldn’t be offended if I tried to get to know her better even when it was blatantly obvious that she wouldn’t (she had the org over at her place multiple times for drinks and party games and she joined in the fun with us). The whole concept just felt very foreign to me. In the end, I think it’s this mindset that caused me grief. I personally think I did have a shot with her, because from what I could tell, she and her boyfriend hooked up very recently. But I let my mind, which demanded strict respectful formality towards her at all times, prevail over my heart and common sense. Thus, I stopped myself from being bold with her and getting into a position where I could’ve shot my shot sooner and preempted the rest of this story. Essentially, I was in the right place at the right time, originally, and then I simply stalled for far too long. \n",

I know that everyone describes this school as \"socially dead\" but its really been getting to me lately with just how depressing it is to be here. I'm writing this in biomed and i look around and all I see is people stuck to there computer screens looking at lecture slides or YouTube, waiting for their next exam. Its not even in libraries, its everywhere i go. People spend week after week studying to maintain their GPA because its \"so important to them\" and because the job market is so competitive now. Most teachers and students don't even seem to care about education, they only care about the end result (yes there are a few outliers, there are people here that enjoy their lives but from my perspective its a very select few). The more I look at it the more everyone to me looks so spineless; they only care about their grades, they only care about internships or career fairs, they don't even care if they like the shitty major their in (most people I've talked to hate their major or lie and say \"oh its interesting\" when they complain about it every other fucking second).\n",

I pretty much hide the fact that im depressed to my friends, family and my SO. I was fine in high school because it was so easy for me compared to college, but I feel as if all of my time and energy now is put into just passing my fucking classes. The more I think about it the more i feel like I don't belong here. I hate my major and Im only doing it for the money involved in my career path. The fact that I fail almost every test because of one question thats worth literally half of the test pisses me off because basing my GPA off of a few questions is a shit way to measure my knowledge. sometimes i feel like id rather work at a fucking Taco Bell than live a life where UCSD Administration is shitting on my mental health.

I know it wasnt truly directed at me and if the person rly knew me he/ she wouldnt have said it. It still brought all the trauma back. I should see a therapist.

He wasnt planning on using it immediately, just keeping it as sort of a peace of mind, but he's telling me now that he doesn't think he'll make it to the end of the week. I've been begging him to get help for a while, and he's calling CAPS tomorrow, but he's planning on withholding enough information to prevent him from getting institutionalized. I know that being in a psych ward doesn't really do anything but physically prevent you from hurting yourself, that he'd still be suicidal when he leaves, and that he'd rather die than go back to a psych ward, but he needs serious help ASAP. He has the philosophy that when someone wants to commit, they should be allowed to do so, but he hasn't really tried any treatments. He's passionate and incredibly talented in what he does, he's done really important work with some of the comp sci professors on campus, has internships lined up for summer, and is almost guaranteed to get into grad school here because of the profs he's worked with (he wants a phD). \n",

Roommate 1&2 used to have a thing in the past but roommate 2 now has a gf who lives out of state. His gf comes to visit from time to time and I can tell that roommate 1 gets distant when she’s around but I assumed it’s just because of the fact that he used to have a thing with roommate 1. However, I discovered that roommate 1 would sometimes sneak in roommate 2’s room and would sleep there and move back to his room before I wake up. I only found out about this because last night, I had the munchies and decided to make myself a hot pocket at 3 am which so happens to be the time roommate 1 stepped out of roommate 2’s bedroom to go back to his bedroom BUT HOMEBOY WAS NAKED. I was so shocked that I dropped my hot fucking pocket on the ground and he immediately said “uhhh he borrowed my charger and I just came to get it” and I was like “oooh ok so where is the charger??” And obviously there was no charger so he confessed that it’s been going on for a while now and basically asked me to keep it a secret. I was too high for that shit so I walked back to my room and ate my hot pocket. So now that I’m sober, idk what to do. Should I tell the gf??? Or should I just let them do their thing and mind my own business??\n",

When you are inside me I feel nothing else. I scream to the world that you are inside me because I care. Because I want them to know on what they are missing. They need to know that you are the thing that pleases me. I love you so much that I had to let you go because we were too much.

It irks me so much because I've struggled with anxiety and depression for years, and whenever I broke up with him he'd pull the \"depression\" card to manipulate me into giving him attention despite never having a history of mental illness. I finally ended things after he anally raped me, after which he would post all these sadboy instagram stories about how he is now depressed and told everyone that I left him for another guy.

The thing is we’ve been talking about my place off campus next year and they always say my place will be the hangout spot since they’re living at home, but like hell if they think I’m giving them a space to do shit without me. The worst part is I’m living with one next year and he already signed the paperwork, so there’s no getting out of it. And it’s not like I’m a bad person or am mean to them, they’ve just gotten closer because they’re all weak nonstem majors and have similar classes. But that doesn’t mean you can fucking plan things without me and expect me to give my everything to you whenever you call. So now I have no friends because I just want to ditch them, only I can’t brcause he’s living with me. They’re the only close enough friend group I made. I feel I have acquaintances but no real close friends to hang out with besides them. So I feel like a fucking begger  still hanging out with them when they plan things without me and coordinate rides without me and settle things around their own schedules without me. And then they say they’re sorry that they didn’t think of me but they always do it again I hate them They can’t even fucking talk to waiters or other kids in class because they’re so antisocial and shy but they’re so fucked up on the inside They’re all fucking losers, so now I guess they can be losers together\n",

When I looked at the boards on Library Walk published my SJP I had an open mind. However, I feel that the boards on Library Walk are villanizing anyone who supports Israel's right to exist. Israel is meant to be a safe haven for an ethnoreligion that has been persecuted for thousands of years (and has been targeted within the San Diego area). Does that mean that I agree with all of Israel's policies regarding Palestine? The short answer is no, and the long answer is I don't feel informed enough about the issue from an unbiased standpoint to comprehensively judge Israel's policies.

She barely does anything for her future and career, besides getting good grades. Basically,she isn’t an ambitious or independent woman. The way she also handles or views certain situations is also sometimes immature.

He went on misogynistic rants about how all women are 'whores' and that we'll never get the dream wife we've always grown up wanting. He told me that the book and his websites have shown him the true 'nature of the universe' and that women are lesser than men. He told me I'm a sucker for being a 'blue pill' chasing after girls who are on 'the carousel' and that my mom is a slut who married my dad for money. I got really fucking pissed about this and went off on him in the middle of pines and told him all that bullshit hes reading is just misogynistic garbage that won't help him 'get women'. Its just salty ass losers who have no game so they blame society for their problems.

This post should have not exploded because it didint say anything controversial. That did not stop the brigade of feminists from attacking the poster. Its funny because a lot of these comments are just seething in hatred for men and masculinity in general.They hate men, they hate gender equality, and they want female supremacy. They want to control which words you are allowed to use, and in which context you are allowed to use them. Im sure some of them are reasonable but its terrifying reading most of those comments.

      "1517 I’ve dealt with mental illness for a majority of my life. It fluctuates, but I always end up severely depressed. I know exactly how I get. I become consumed by rage to the point where I can’t believe what someone tells me, regardless of whether I know it to be true or not. I’ve contemplated suicide more times in my life than I can count. When I was around 14, I was actually going to do it, but someone sent an anonymous tip to the police. I was almost forcibly hospitalized, but I was able to avoid that by agreeing to therapy. Therapy has been a mixed bag for me. My first one blamed me for my parents marital issues and overall just berated me (it was group therapy). My second one was a lot better, but I stopped feeling better as sessions continued. She also didn’t believe that I had depression, but thought I fit the description for adjustment disorder. I look at myself and don’t know who I am anymore. When my emotions consume me, I’m unable to think clearly and I isolate myself from all of my friends. I overreact and push them away, knowing full well what I’m doing but not being able to do anything. I also begin to disassociate, and feel like I’m not the person inside my own body. It feels like I’m another person watching all of this happen before my eyes. At times, I don’t feel any emotion at all, just an absolute emptiness. I feel so fucking helpless. I’ve definitely gotten worse after coming to college. I’ve started hearing voices in my head. They happen at night and reinforce all the doubts I have by convincing me that my friends despise me and that I need to rid myself of them. I feel crazy, and I don’t want to tell anyone because they’ll think I’m insane. I’ve made a CAPS appointment but it’s so far away that I’m just so fearful that I will remain this person ravaged by ire, self-hatred, and perpetual doubt. I was doing so well recently too, but I suppose that some things aren’t meant to be.\n",

A few weeks later I asked her about it in person. tl;dr she said that she doesn't not like me but also added that she doesn't know when she'll be \"better\" mentally to start a relationship (but she didn't tell me exactly what the issue was), that it might take a few months or a few years.

You two didnt talk on a regular basis, and had that been the case you probably would have found out about her SO sooner.

It sounded like a bad case of infatuation, as opposed to actually liking her for who she is as a person. You also mentioned she was graduating, so even if she did say yes there was no guarantee anything wouldve worked out after this coming June. The right person will come around eventually. Rather than focus on getting a girlfriend, focus on how YOU can be a better boyfriend, and work towards those qualities. People will see the effort you’ve made towards that goal and naturally admire you, and eventually you’ll meet the one. I know that’s how I met mine.

I'm kind of an outsider since I haven't been in the same sequence with them throughout their years in the major and kinda showed up out of nowhere. I didn't really get to know a lot of them in the class we shared last quarter, but I know who the driven/smart ones are compared to the unmotivated/slow ones. So I'm half frustrated that I ended up in a group with people I know procrastinate and that are slow to understand stuff. Sure, they're my \"friends\" -  I helped them on homework they procrastinated on and needed help on last minute. And I did choose them as my partners. But working with them so far has really been a one-sided affair, with only me contributing to the project. To some extent, I make solace with myself by saying that, if I didn't step up and ask them to be in my group, then others would have to be dissatisfiedin having them as partners and for their grades to suffer instead... Thankfully, I was able to get a good amout of the project work done, which will allow me to keep the project smooth sailing and help them understand what's going on, so they don't try to fight me and (mistakenly) tell me I'm wrong (which they have done for past homeworks because they don't use the right information!) Man it's just a lot easer when at least ONE of the other group members knows what's going on... Well... Good luck to all y'alls group projects out there.\n",

When I do get the chance to hang out with my roommates I'm almost always the fifth wheel. I even joined greek life and I am a part of it now, but I somehow always feel alone, and it feels extremely hard to get myself to go out to all the events going on when I'm so self conscious. I joined greek life on the hopes that it would push me outside of my comfort zone, but instead it has made me feel like I don't belong anywhere on this campus.

Having to work my ass off to get here as a first-gen student only to have to compete with obnoxiously cliquey racist east asian international students who cheat to get by is bullshit and it sucks that this isn't being addressed better by the administration. Add to it, that I personally believe a lot of the \"socially dead\" aspect of this school can be attributed to that demographic of students, just leaves no good-will towards them. This is obviously not the case for every east asian international student, the ones I have had the pleasure to actually socialize with, without being seen a lesser poor brown person, have been very friendly and good people. It may be bad that I am generalizing the entirety of that population, but in my personal experience, they've been shitholes 9 time out of 10.

Some times I feel like everything is a dream and I’m just watching everything and everyone go thru with life behind a window. When I get anxiety attacks...I start feeling out of place as if no one wants me around which causing me to want to be alone so I go to my room or somewhere alone...then the shaking starts..an uncontrollable shaking.. then i can even feel the blood going thru my veins as I start hyperventilating. I swear I try to breathe but nothing works it feels like there’s no oxygen for me to breathe in....then at that point where I’m just sitting in the corner feeling horrible it gets worse...I start hearing (remembering) things that people would tell me. Whenever a mean coach would yell and tell me I sucked well that would come to mind...whenever my mom would yell at me call me stupid and that I won’t make it well that would come to mind...Everything. You just hear everything and it just all attacks you at once. Then you get a feeling inside you that you want to scream so loud but you can’t because you don’t want anyone else to hear. It’s all this until all you can do is lay on the ground and cry. Cry so much your head and eyes hurt.....And that everyone...is anxiety. \n",

It really seems like it's the internationals that have a vested interest in this behavior. It's very unfair. Especially to us American(regardless of your ethnic background) students. Sure they pay a lot more but at what cost? Their dishonest work discredits ours, degrades of degrees and hinders our quality of education. Most international student's don't even stay in the U.S after graduation to work and stimulate our economy. Most go back to China, Korea, India, Saudi Arabia--flaunt their U.S degrees, work in their home country, stimulate their economies, all the while us Americans take the hit. \n",

I started to live a very “normal” American lifestyle that is typically unusual to see in my religious community.

I often feel like a hypocrite and am ashamed of myself, but I like that I do what I want. I have been excluded from my religious community because I allowed myself to be who I have wanted to be, but sometimes I wonder if this is the right thing to do. It really sucks.

      "1937 Response to 12527: You're good. To me, it makes absolutely no sense how forming an arbritrary agreement with one person prevents you from feeling attraction towards another. ***Your body does not \"know\" you agreed to be exclusive to someone, so being unable to form new romantic feelings towards another person makes absolutely no sense***. I think what's more likely is once someone is cuffed they spend majority of their time and social energy on that one person so other people do not seem attractive not because of choice, but because of the nature of relationships and the amount of time and social energy spent with one's S/O. Consider this: John and Jane are in a relationship with one another. Jane moves to another State for grad school. There she meets Brian, someone who is kind, attractive, funny, smart, definitely everything she wants in an S/O, and they start spending enormous amounts of time together. You're telling me that she wouldn't once consider having a relationship with him instead of John? Because of what? The \"forces of love\"? I don't think so. Obviously that's an extreme scenario, but point is no, don't feel bad about feeling those feelings.\n",

      "1967 Sun God diary, figured this would be a good therapeutic exercise and some people might relate. I didn't have a group of people who I made plans with, so I went alone, figuring I would see some of my friends. I run into a couple people from a club after a half hour of wandering and chill with them for a bit, keeping me busy. They eventually split apart and I bump into a buddy from another org, who says we should stick together. They're not the type of person who would get on me for being a bit of a downer, so I start to feel more comfortable. I eventually run into my bestie after Joji's set and we hang out for a bit, until I decided to go further into the crowd during Vince's set to jam. Didn't know anyone and it seemed like a lot of people were out of it or had little experience with rap shows, so I go back out to find my group. My last crush walks past me as I anxiously look around for my friend, giving a quick wave. This made me feel happy, but also kind of taken aback and the \"it was an awkward acknowledgement, they're not happy to see you\" thought quickly begins to run on repeat. I cry for a minute and come to the realization that my bestie probably dipped. I go into the mosh pit on a whim and wind up having a good time, elbow to the jaw notwithstanding. As I leave, the synagogue tragedy news is the first thing I see on my phone, immediately turning the high from the pit into a feeling of grief and resigned disgust (Jew in Trumpland here.) I get some food after not eating for seven hours and another crying fit comes on. I can tell that nobody is looking, so I just let it happen. I find a bit of relief and briefly chuckle about the fact that I'm crying while shoveling down fries. Within a few minutes, that chuckle turns into an \"oh fuck, this is where I'm at now\" realization. I get a \"u okay\" text from my dad, which he usually sends if I forget to respond to his messages for a bit. My phone battery is at 1%, so I don't respond, again. I get back to my apartment and sit on the couch, thinking nobody is home. I start to hear the sounds of puking a minute later and begin weeping profusely, running to my room. Saw some old friends later on that night and enjoyed myself, perking up my mood overall. I might have had another cry before I went to sleep, could have been a different night though. I generally feel like I'm on the outside looking in and SG proved to be no different, but I knew that would probably be the case going into it. I put myself out there in situations where I feel like a fish out of water because I know it will benefit me in the long run, and still ultimately enjoyed myself more than I thought I would. 3/5\n",

I was friends with a guy and at first he liked me a lot and asked me out and b/c I didn't see him as a romantic partner, I rejected him (respectfully/nicely). He was understanding, so we stayed friends. A week later, his friends curse and yell at me for constantly leading him on and flirting with him. I showed the guy (who liked me) the screenshots and he told me to ignore them and that he'll talk with them. Those rude comments/texts came up again and again. So I blocked them all. Then my mutual friend (who's friends with the same guy) got us back in contact. He and I stayed friends long term and started betting again (like we used to), then he got a girlfriend. And at first, tbh I felt sad that I wasn't getting the attention from him like I used. But now, I'm really happy for him. Because his last ex (long-distance relationship) really teared him to pieces and he's a great friend too! I think we were meant to be friends and I'm glad we still are to this day.\n",

She asked if anyone had been diagnosed, and the two other people who spoke about it said they overall had negative experiences with medication and stopped taking it. I shared that i experience some negative side effects, but overall the benefits far outweigh the side effects. She proceeded to talk about how ADHD is essentially how kids act anyway and that everyone could take a pill and act super human if they were given one. I definitely understand the idea that ADHD is being diagnosed more and more, and how it's only really a diagnosis because those diagnosed don't work well in the societal environment that has been created, but I just felt like she was dismissive of the real struggle it can be. I hated myself and thought I was a lazy idiot for years until I got treated for ADHD. I still like her as a proof, but that was a bit frustrating.\n",

      "2035 No one cares. The thought that echoes in my mind every morning when I wake, when I brush my teeth, when I go to school, and until I drift into the emptiness at night. To realize that it’s no one’s responsibility to care is a heart shattering realization. To know that you’re falling deeper and deeper into a pit and know that any one of the people you’re falling past could reach out and pull you back into the safety of love, acceptance, and empathy. Maybe they don’t know you’re suffering. Maybe they’re not paying attention. Maybe they have their own problems to figure out. Maybe they realize how much of a burden it is to be your friend and it’s easier to avoid. Regardless of the reason, the truth is that you’re alone. Alone with your thoughts, alone with your feelings, alone with your cares and desires in this world. \n",
      "\n",
      "This sense of loneliness compounds with every glance at a kissing couple, friends laughing, etc. You ask yourself why other people have friends, have significant others, have love, acceptance, have fun, and the only rationale explanation is that you weren’t chosen. This feeling of being the last one picked, the odd one out, is something you’ve become all too familiar with. From gym class and teams in middle school to projects in college, the polite ones glance down to avoid eye-contact or say, “Ummm, I’m actually already with x.” You realize pretty quickly that you’ve been standing for too long, left out hanging. Your body squirms with the discomfort from the gaze of others. Your entire existence is skipped over until the silence of the second last person being picked and you slowly drag yourself over to the other team. Last picked alludes to some notion of being chosen when that couldn’t be further from the truth. You weren’t chosen. An unlucky team or person was stuck with you. You’re given to someone who doesn’t want you, like an ad placed in your mailbox or more adeptly a parking ticket stuck onto someone’s windshield. You didn’t choose this life of torment and yet it was likewise thrust upon you.\n",
      "\n",
      "You ask yourself where did it all go wrong? How could you be born into this world like everyone else yet end up so different, so far from everyone else? Everyone’s origin story is different. Mine began in middle school. Before, I felt like I was just another kid for the most part. Things changed when I was evicted from my elementary school and forcibly placed into middle school. I was warned that the school might be a bad culture fit. Like the naive kid I was, I didn’t give it much thought. The message that I was unwanted was slowly bled into my mind. From the teachers to the students, it was made clear that no one wanted me there. I didn’t belong. I wasn’t white. I wasn’t rich. I didn’t play club sports. I didn’t wear Quick Silver, Hurley, or the stereotypical clothes from other students. A memory etched eternally in my mind is returning to class after lunch and since all the boys played outside, we were all sweaty and dirty. My eighth grade teacher greeted each of them with a smile but that smile quickly vanished when her eyes laid on me. “Go clean yourself up, you look absolutely disgusting” still echoes in my mind and the feeling of being lesser than are still branded in mind with a wound as fresh as the day those hot iron words struck my ears. This realization wasn’t something that happened overnight. It was like most things in this world, slow and steady. You begin as a flat grassy field with just a small trickle of disgust and disdain for your existence trickling through and before you know it, you’re left with a huge hole in your existence, a giant grand canyon of with thunderous waves of anxiety, depression, and self-loathing.\n",

      "Time passes and the people around you change. You change schools and eventually leave to a different city for college. Your tormentors and peers long forget about you with you being a distant memory ever shrinking in their rear view mirror as they drive toward their rest, discovering the fruits of life, things that make things worth living, friends, love, and success. You cough as the dust spun up by the tires catches in your throat and eventually they fade from your view. But they’ve left their mark upon you forever. What was outside and external, these thoughts of not being accepted, of being ugly, of not being good enough have slowly but surely seeped through the pores of your skin and now have corrupted your mind. They don’t need to be there to say it anymore because your mind already says it for them. You don’t need to hear the laughter from others when they make fun of your feelings on a crush, you now tell yourself, no, you know that you’re not good enough. Undeserving of love. Undeserving of affection. Undeserving of friendship. Filled with rage at yourself for being stupid enough to think that you could ever have those things you saw others enjoy. The hand of life slaps your childlike hands away from the candy at the supermarket checkout counter like a scolding mother. \n",
      "\n",
      "How many bad days does it take to change you a person? To corrupt what one was good, kind, and loving into something cynical? Maybe every rejection, every mean jab ever made, maybe every hurtful thing is like a stab to your heart until the skin scars and hardens. How many more days can you take before you decide it's preferable to die and kill yourself rather than go on another day locked inside of your mind, your life? What will be the final thing that breaks you so utterly and completely you lose all hope for life? Do you know what or when it will be or does it strike from nowhere? I know not the answers to these questions but am afraid I may find out the answer soon.\n",

And while I might empathize both of these sentiments to some extent, what I really crave is someone who can provide something more enthralling than my solitude. I've experienced significant others with extreme love and depth. I've have friends with benefits. I've been in relationships lasting years that I thought I could share a life long companionship with. (I should say, I went to college late, and as such grad school late, so had the time to accumulate such experiences). Through all of this, the one take away is - that we learn about ourselves through others. Whether its as simple as learning about our romantic preferences, or learning the darkest parts of ourselves through the sordid experiences that only the depths of connecting with another human can inspire and teach.\n",

Blacks, native Americans, Asians, and latinos have been discriminated against by various governments for centuries. Pleaseeee don’t try to act like the world is coming after white people. If you have done this, you should be ashamed. Instead of being upset that people like to make “white people think ketchup is spicy” or “white privilege” comments/jokes, LISTEN to what PoC are telling you. You will never be black, asian, Hispanic, etc. so do not tell someone how they should or shouldn’t feel about something.

I still get surprised sometimes when I hear people say things like that about me here at UCSD because, quite honestly, I thought I would have left that type of behavior when I graduated from middle school. While I’m able to not let those comments get to me as much as I used to, unfortunately because of how often I’ve already received those comments in the past and come to better terms with the scars they have left on me, for a lot of other people that’s a lot easier said than done. My point here is please just watch what you say, even if you think you’re just joking or if it wasn’t your intention to come off in a mean way. You never know how much a few words can make or break someone’s day, nor do you know what someone might be going through.

We go for it one more time in the morning before I leave and I couldn’t cum. My body just wouldn’t let me. I was kinda bored.

      "2090 So this is a cautionary tale about how I hit a car at Trader Joe’s back in February but it’s been haunting me since. I tried to park into one of those tiny parking spots and I hit (scratched) a car.  It was like almost 10pm and the driver of the car I hit was in the car. It was 100% my fault and I was ready to exchange my insurance info and whatnot. Stuff got weird when he gave me the option to pay him $200 cash or make a police/insurance report. I had no cash on me and so I told him I’d rather do an insurance claim. He started getting really pushy about me “giving him a number” (cash) so that I wouldn’t have to make an insurance claim. It kinda felt like extortion. I should note that he was an older Asian man which makes it weird since he finally left me alone after he asked me simply “are you a student? Do you you speak Spanish?” To which I answered yes and he was like NVM FORGET ABOUT IT and left. I still made a police report afterwards just in case it was reported as a hit and run but a lot of people told me it might’ve been a scam. Please be careful out there everyone 😔\n",

Her personality changed a bit mostly due to working environment, became a bit more commanding, type A stuff. Her interests shifted into photography, Instagram fame, tinder, thrill seeking... I mean, I know, tinder is already a red flag. I went clear with her about my opinions on dating applications, and she insists and promises that it is for sole usages to get followers(???). Idk man, don't ask me. Partly maybe just because she's lonely and in need of attention? Dude the logic is a mess, anyway, an exclusive simple relationship was my request. \n",

I had every intention of hooking up with this guy this weekend, just physical, nothing more. But after spending the weekend with him and nothing happening physically, I feel things for him that I’ve never felt for anyone. He’s kind and smart and funny and Wen like the same music and we collect the same stuff. It’s kinda creepy, but I can’t stop imagining having a life with him. I’m now pretty sure that he doesn’t feel the same, and it hurts. We are still friends and I’m happy to have him in my life, but I wonder if I can ever feel like this again.

Nobody cares if you take a shit loudly or quietly.  Just take your shit, and move one with your lives so that others can use the bathroom also. Its ok to fart loud, or take a loud shit - even if you’re a girl. Its natural and we all do it. Also, don’t use a public bathroom to check your emails or play with your phone. First of all, that is very unsanitary, and second, its rude. \n",

      "\n",
      "Alright so I've had around like 10 hours of experience with the new Smash Ultimate Stage Builder so I've decided to make a guide for people who are new and wanna try shit out so they don't have to spend the first few hours figuring everything out.\n",
      "\n",
      "Basics\n",
      "1) The Grid.  Press Y and check the grid near the bottom left.  It'll make keeping the stage symmetrical a million times easier.\n",
      "\n",
      "2) Highlighting.  You can drag a square to select multiple objects at once which makes it possible to move things around at the same time.  \n",
      "\n",
      "3) Layers.  There's 4 layers: back-background, background, stage, and foreground.  You can change one you're drawing in by pressing Y then selecting the layer you want.  \n",
      "\n",
      "4) L button. Press the L button to draw a straight line if you're in free hand, a square if you're in rectangle mode, and a circle if you're in ellipse mode.\n",
      "\n",
      "5) Undo button.  Instead of tapping the undo button on the top left every time you make a mistake, just press the left button on the D-pad.  Make it a habit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Terrain\n",
      "6) Bouncing rubber.  Bouncing rubber does not make you bounce or jump higher.  However falling objects do bounce off of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "7) Lava. Lava is technically a terrain.  Keep this in mind in the future.\n",
      "\n",
      "8) Falling objects.  You can select a block of terrain and it opens a menu that allows you to turn on gravity.  This means the block will fall instead of floating in the air like an actual stage. \n",
      "\n",
      "9) Circles.  Circular objects WILL roll on an incline if they fall on one.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Hazards\n",
      "9) Bomb/Explosive Blocks.  Bomb/explosive blocks do no damage.  Bomb blocks basically exist to active explosive blocks to create destructible terrain.\n",
      "\n",
      "10) Hazards + Terrain.  The most important note in this guide: pretty much everything else is just buildup.  So, hazards such as cannons and bumpers are fixed on the map.  However if a hazard is attached to Terrain with Gravity turned on, then it  falls with the terrain.  So you can essentially create a falling bumper/cannon by attaching it to a small piece of terrain with the gravity turned on.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Other\n",
      "11) Switches.  Switches do not activate bomb/explosive blocks.  They work by activating/inactivating the gear attached to the terrain they are on. \n",
      "\n",
      "12) Gears + Gravity.  If you turned on the gravity for terrain to make a falling object but then attach a gear, that object becomes fixed in the air again.  So basically you can't create a turning object that falls.   \n",
      "\n",
      "13) Save online stages.  Even though Nintendo bans \"inappropriate\" stages, people still post them.  If you see a good stage, save it before it gets taken down!\n",

      "2197 I had put on this “passionate student leader” facade in front of my coworkers (all of whom actually work for the school and aren’t students) for nearly 3 years now at my on campus job that is related to student leadership. But in reality I just do not give a fuck about student leadership and professionalism the staff there always preaches. I see the entirety of the professional staff there as people who did not figure out what they wanted to do after college, so they decided to just work for university instead claiming a career in “Student Advising” or “Student Leadership” or some BS. I doubt any sane person ever went to undergrad and thought to themselves “I wish I had a major or career path that will literally never let me leave college ever again!”\n",

I’m so numb to how much it’s actually affecting my job there, but I could care less because my coworkers also do not genuinely care about the students they serve half of the time anyways, despite it being in their job descriptions. The departments like mine claim to “enhance the student experience” when half of the time you are degraded and treated like shit BECAUSE you are a dumb student.\n",

That’s the student leadership I live for and is why I initially thought this job I applied for would feel like. But when I have to do similar stuff for work, there’s no passion or emotion behind the projects and events my department puts on. Because it’s run by staff who need to fill an arbitrary quota and enforce stupid policies during the planning and executions of the event. And no matter how good or bad it goes they get a paycheck anyways.\n",

Saying the truth means so much more to me than anyone can ever imagine (By speaking the truth I do not include being rude and straight up pointing things out or calling someone out. I do believe sometimes you can't speak the truth to be considerate of the person, which depends on the environment and the concept which gets complicated. I just mean straight up lying about something here). My boyfriend, despite knowing how much I value the truth, has lied to me about something over the course of our entire relationship and only told me now after we've been dating for about 6 or 7 months. Almost a year since we've met. I did not know what to do when he told me and it was through text, the night before my midterm when I was studying. Because of this I ended up pulling an all-nighter trying to study while the shock was in my mind and ended up passing out at a commuter lounge. Besides all that, I made an exception and gave my boyfriend a second chance because I really love him. Now here's where things gets a little complicated. Since then, I've unintentionally started to emotionally abuse my boyfriend (i realized this, and he knows it too). By unintentionally, I stopped sharing things as much and did alot of things that were described on articles describing an emotionally abuse relationship and later realized that these are actually a part of an abusive relationship. Despite knowing that, my boyfriend decides to stay with me because he told me that he loves me. A part of me hated doing this because I know it is morally wrong, but the other part of me feels like  he deserved at least some of it because he knew how lying impacts me and how much I values the truth, but decides to lie anyways. I have multiple evidence of he telling me that he's never lied to me and never will, just to later on find out that he was lying making these lies as well. During the course of the \"emotional abuse\", he blames himself that this happened because he lied to me. Right now we've gotten to an agreement that we'll work through this together, but I'm honestly lost. I don't know where to begin because my mind is telling me that he's lied to me and I'm too insecure to put trust into him again, but I really love him and I want to do it. Also apologies if this post is a mess and hard to understand because that's literally what my life is right now. A mess.\n",

The most popular tunes of today are just not the kind of things that I feel are going to go down in history-remixes and electronic music just aren't the same as as a rock band or an orchestra.

During that time, I usually live in a big house or in smaller bunkhouses with 7-15 strangers from many different places. These strangers are usually pretty 50/50 on girls to guys-which is really progressive for engineering/physics lol. Anyways, for the past couple of times I've done this kind of work, I've never hooked up or had any kind of relations with any of the girls I'm living with. Some have relationships of course, but I don't know how to make the move with any of the others and, well, it gets lonely out there. But then again, you're kinda stuck for most days with the same few people and these people are the only people around for miles.

Asian girls and white guy couples are actually beautiful and perhaps better than asian girl dating asian guy couple...

If you respond to someone saying they don’t like Californians by raving about how awesome California is and how much you love the beach and where you’re from, you totally missed the point. No one’s mad you like living here and don’t want to leave !!!! Nobody would argue that the weather and the beach and having cultural hubs like LA and SF is bad. That why we come here!! \n",
      "The problem is with the people who grow up here, have never left, and thus have no perspective about life outside of California. And I get not everybody has the means to travel, that’s understandable. But I have had too many people who grew up in the Bay or OC and never lived anywhere else spew opinions at me about why the rest of the country sucks and why people in the Midwest or South are bad. It’s nonsense. And people saying they have no desire to leave EVER kinda just show how little they care about the rest of the country, which is very stereotypical for you all.\n",
      "Part of what drove me to go out of state for college was to live in a totally new place and be around people from different backgrounds and who have different experiences. So coming here and being met with a lot of Californians who have so many preconceived notions about the rest of the country and no desire to actually learn about them is INCREDIBLY disheartening. I’ve lived in 4 different states in very different regions of the US and this is the first place I’ve experienced anything like this. It’s part of the reason I have no desire to stay here after I graduate, even though the state itself is so wonderful 😓\n",

You guys aren’t popular, it’s really sad to see how hard Asian “frats” like KP try to feel like they are part of Greek life. No one in these orgs would ever make it into an actual fraternity. They use their org as a way to promote themselves as lit or whatever when in reality they are all still the same losers they were in high school.

We aren't out & about making fun of guy's height, we just have our own preferences and ideal types. At the end of the day, the person we end up having a romantic relationship with might not even be tall (as we \"imagined\") and it won't even matter as long as we love them for who they are. Yes, it's hard to grow, but it's also hard to lose weight. God created us all very differently, we literally come in different shapes and sizes, but that doesn't mean that all tall girls are bxtches and want to be with  a tall guy. Some girls prefer men who are the same height even shorter, there's nothing wrong about it. But societal norms are usually the guys are taller, if not, the same height as women. I dated two guys in the past who were both over 6ft. And recently crushed on a guy who's actually shorter than me, but we ended up being just good friend (not bc of his height) but b/c he's a freshman and I'm a senior & I don't swerve like that, LOL. My thesis for this whole thing was, pls don't attack people's preferences/ideal types when it's all based on the norms of society. \n",

When I see a girl wearing big sweats and you can still see her booty through them, it’s like damn, she can fill those? That’s hot. Or if they’re in a big T-Shirt or hoodie or honestly anything, you can just tell they’re more comfortable so they are walking around more naturally. Seeing them be attractive effortlessly is just as satisfying. And girls in comments might say “not me” or “only certain girls look good like this” but honestly this has always been my experience.

      "2432 With just days to go before my supply of jerky and nuts from home finally runs out, I recently went out on a hunt with my trusty rifle at my side and came across this most majestic goose. Had a bit of a gander and found that she was leading all of her little goslings around in a nearby lake. I suppose that indicated that she was the mother goose. However, I couldn’t bring myself to raise my rifle to secure sustenance for the next couple of days. It’s not because of all the goslings surrounding her. Truth of the matter is that, one day, we all have to leave our mothers and brothers and sisters to lead our own lives and worlds. Also, I need grub and ain’t gonna starve to death when there’s a source of fresh protein right there in front of me. But rather, it’s because I am afraid that I’ll miss and all it will quite literally turn into a wild goose chase. \n",

      "You see, I’ve never been a very good hunter or marksman. Never had anything to show for these hunts. Always aimed a bit too high or got a bit too close. I know a number of people who are excellent hunters and marksmen, who come back with sacks full of their kills. On the flip side, there are people like the British hunter I befriended, a man as calm and refined as Zaroff yet nowhere near as successful or murderous, as well as another gentleman from the former Raj whom I also befriended, another unsuccessful big game hunter who also hasn’t been particularly successful. We all give each other hunting tips despite being equally unsuccessful in the field. Don’t know how useful the tips we give each other are, but by God, the camaraderie we have between us almost makes all the pain from bad hunts worth it, and I thank the Lord everyday I have them in my life. I pray to our heavenly Father that one day, they will all get their big break and finally have something to show for their efforts.\n",

If I don’t go out there again and at least try to get that goose before she and her goslings go away, then my goose will really be cooked (haha, the irony). Then I’ll be left wondering if my situation could have ended up different and better, if starvation and failure was the only option, if I would have been successful. Well, I suppose I ought to quit acting like a silly goose myself. No more anxiety. No more delays. It’s time to shoot my shot. \n",

They are pretty cute guys and really charming I might add. The problem is all of them had a small penis for my taste (around 3-4.5 inches). I had a really bad and awkward experience with one of the guys at 3 am. It was really late and I went over to his single. We never discussed his size or anything which was a mistake I realize now. When he whipped his small noodle out I was really disappointed it was so small. I tried to ride his dick, and I felt nothing at all. It was the most boring and uneventful sex I had ever had. I understand that a lot of asian guys are really smart and make a lot of money, but most of them unfortunately have a small penis which I cannot accept. I don’t understand why evolution hasn’t been kind to asian men as they have been to Black and Latino men. Since that day in October 12 at 3 am in the Muir singles, I have stuck to latino and black guys. Let me just say that one black guy was so big and perfect that I could feel it in my stomach. I’m sorry that asian men can’t seem to hold up when comparing to black or Latino guys, but that’s just the way it is. A gal like me needs some vitamin D, and I’m just sad that asian men can’t fulfill me :(. What do I do? I \n",

      "2490 I met this guy, a while back, while working out at the gym on campus; some engineering undergrad or something. We would frequent the gym at similar times, and eventually started working out together. Big dude, large muscles, manly...your typical jock. Unsurprisingly, he was full of stories about all his hot-chick hookups (due to his inevitably attractive looks, you see). Most stories involved him going somewhere and having girls beg to be with him, multiple at a time, a real panty dropper you see. Well, one day, while finishing up a workout, he mentioned this party (gettogether) happening at his place later that night, suggesting I should go as it was \"bound to be full of ass\". I, being a grad student with nothing better to do on a Friday night, decided to go.  And yes, I must admit the place was full of people, men and women, but mostly chicks; the slutty-looking, cock-thristy kind, as he described them. Anyway, after many drinks, I ended up in what appeared to be a sex room; sparse groups of people performing some sort of sexual act. He was there, with a random chick. Honestly, it didn't feel uncomfortable (having gone through the \"wild\" stages of sexual exploration during undergrad, it seemed normal; or at least tolerable). What sorta was strange was being pulled aside by him to \"play\" with the chick accompanying him, which then turned into me fucking her. After some time, this jocky, manly, iron-pumping stallion of a panty dropper mentioned that \"since I was having so much fun pleasuring this girl, I should go ahead and pound him some\". Weird request, I must admit. But eh, I pounded his tight little asshole. It is rather interesting how impressions and stereotypical expectations work at times. I have not seen him at the gym since, although the chick from that night comes by my office during the evenings at least once a week. \n",

What I am actually scared about is having my body deteriorate. I'm no athlete but I always took care of myself. I've always been able to push past my limits by just trying hard enough. But I dread that one day I might wake up and suddenly not be able to do the things I used to do. Imagine waking up and realizing your stamina, strenght, flexibility, and even intelligence are slowly getting worse and worse. I know I can slow this down but I can't completely prevent it.

There are certain hard lines that you do not cross, and you need to learn about those lines. I like to think those hard boundaries are common sense, but apparently not, so I recommend you ask around.

      "2531 to #11721, after seeing your three posts and reading all the harsh comments from other people, I have to say that I can relate with you as a fellow Christian. I'm not a guy, but I also get slightly turned on when I see some attractive guys (face-wise or body-wise). Since I'm a girl, Idk if I would be labeled as a \"creep\" like you were. Yes, there is something immoral about such reactions, but that doesn't define us as creeps. I'd say that someone is a creep if they end up crossing boundaries, such as taking photos, stalking, verbally/physically harassing the person, etc. Hormones can be hard to control, especially in college.\n",
      "In response to your predicament though, I'd say that you have to decide whether your spiritual life or physical life is more important. Of course, nothing seems to be going wrong for your friends who have sex, but that's only based off of your judgement. God is there to judge, so you only need to focus on yourself. What happens to other people isn't going to necessarily be the same for you. You might end up feeling extremely guilty if you have sex before marriage. You'll further distance yourself away from God as well. I'm a Christian, but I've had multiple sexual partners and I can't tell you how guilty I feel. I'm worried about how it affects my relationship with God. But then again, I also believe that He already knew I would have these sins. Under religious standards, sex is meant to be a gift that you enjoy with your special person. I personally support your sexual abstinence because it'll bring you greater rewards. If you do give in to that temptation, it'll be hard to control it afterwards. Just a fair warning. and of course, with any sin, you should try to repent for it. If you don't, you're kinda just disregarding His authority. Whatever happens, God has love for everyone, so don't feel burdened.\n",
      "And to the non-religious people, I know you're extremely skeptical of Christianity, but Christianity, and any other religion, does provide meaning, guidance, and hope to people's lives. Religion isn't a scapegoat for one's shortcomings and it isn't an escape from reality. Some of us just care a lot about our spiritual lives and it's hard to decide whether we care about the spiritual or physical side of things. It isn't an easy task to disregard religion, so it makes sense why OP is having a hard time over this. Religion is just something we value and trust in a lot. Having a lot of trust in something usually leads to obedience. I know it sounds hypocritical of me to say that, but I'm still a growing Christian (fairly new to be honest) and I'm learning how to trust in God more so that I can be obedient. Practicing obedience also means that you have the patience for God's rewards. And these rewards may not necessarily manifest physically. I know that y'all don't agree, and that's totally fine. It's hard for Christians to fully agree with the Bible too. \n",
      "ANYWAYS, I don't want this to turn into a religious debate or whatever, I just couldn't silently read some of the comments on the original post. Like hey, practicing sexual abstinence doesn't mean you're ugly or that you lack social skills, it just means you got a lot of willpower for the Lord lol. It's not that hard to find a hookup nowadays. Also, I think that a lot of the girls on campus are pretty in some way, so yea that Triton eye comment was pretty mean.\n",

      "2560 I'm not gonna lie, I'm a fairly ample girl. Out of the blue last week, a guy came up to me while I was eating lunch, said I was hot, and after an admittedly fun conversation, asked me out. As much as it's fucked up to say in our fat-phobic world, this is highly unusual for guys. So I, in bewilderment, (And because he wasn't too bad looking) accepted and we had a couple minor yet great dates. Last night we got together again to watch GOT and I could tell he was trying to make a move for the bedroom. Things heated up and as we were undressing to do the dirty, he just casually mentioned that he liked bigger girls. I didn't know what to say but it made me uncomfortable as he went on to describe and praise areas of my body I'm usually uncomfortable with people commenting on. I guess it's the same as people saying \"you have great tits\" or something but it was just super weird. Anyways, we ended up having sex but I couldn't orgasm while thinking that I was starting a relationship with a guy who only liked me for my fetishized body. I'm not sure how to go forward with this guy-is this the norm for girls like me? I mean he didn't seem malicious or abusive or anything-his comments jsut made me feel out of my element and I do like him overall. I just need advice. Thanks.\n",

I am so incredibly lucky to just be able to get out and be educated here. people like me are not supposed to make it out, I remember my principal in middle school telling me how I’m gonna end up in some jail and be a total failure. but i do my  best not to let these things get tome. I don’t give a fuck that I am at disadvantage and that I have to work extra hard to catch up. the bottom line is no amount of complaining about the administration will help me get better grades.I am here in the same school as all these other kids and i just need to work hard to achieve my goals . so to anyone who feels secluded and a disadvantage. if i can make it then so can you just trust in yourself and work hard.

      "2745 I hate school. I always have. I do fine, I get A’s and B’s, but it’s almost completely meaningless to me. It has of course completely taken over my life and I hate that my life revolves around something I don’t like at all. I used to have so many passions and had a bunch of hobbies but I don’t do any of them anymore. Being in school as made me lose my passion for everything I do. Every time I want to do something I have to prioritize school. Most of my classes aren’t even related to my major, which just makes it worse. This quarter has been really tough so far and I spent thirty hours doing homework for a class that has nothing to do with my major this last week. Yes, thirty hours of homework for one class, in one week. I also have a part time job and three other classes, also not related to my major, because of the requirements I have to fulfill. What if I don’t pass all my classes this quarter and don’t graduate like I’m supposed to? That will only make things worse. I’m only in school because I feel like I have no other option, and don’t want to be without the safety net a degree provides. I wish there was another way. :( \n",

      "I have a friend who has been increasingly rude to me, and even though I try to be kind in return, they always say \"well that's unusual, you're always so mean to me\". Honestly, I don't know if I have a right to be upset, because it's natural for people joke around a lot. It's just that I don't feel like we're that close, and I don't insult them back. It's also confusing because they occasionally do nice things for me (such as share notes or get food together), but then for the next few days they make a big deal about how nice they are.\n",
      "They've said things like \"are you so dumb that you have to take notes about XXX topic?\", \"Shut up and buy me food\", and \"Why'd you sit in my seat, you ruin everything.\" In class, they'll use my desk as personal storage for their items, talk frequently, poke me/grab my hand while I'm writing, write on my notebook, and physically take away my notebook. It's pretty distracting because I'm already struggling in that class, and I just want to get a decent grade. I don't do any of these things back to them, and I've told them several times variations of \"please don't touch my stuff\" or \"why can't you use your own desk?\" I've tried to keep it light, but I honestly can't take it anymore. \n",
      "Sorry if I'm being oversensitive, I just needed to get that out there. If anyone has any advice, it would be appreciated :) I know I should probably get more confidence and just straight up tell them that I don't like how they're treating me. Unfortunately, I can't just ignore them because we'll be in class for the rest of the quarter and we share a couple outside commitments (orgs, etc) that I value too much to quit. \n",

And you know what? You're right. I'm a big fat goofball with my friends because I don't care how they see me--they're my friends and we unconditionally love each other. But with him, he is absolutely everything I could ask for, and the stakes feel higher, which is why it has been harder for me to completely wind down and be comfortable being the goofy, fun, dumbass that I am.  We are steadily getting better over time, and I was just having a moment of weakness and impatience with the fact that we aren't there yet. I already know it's up to me to work on me, but he holds my hand through it all and I couldn't bear not having him in my life. I love him. I'm in love with him.\n",

We are different colleges and different majors so we really don’t have any overlap but I just really dig his vibes and want to get to know him better. But jokes on me because I would never initiate or hit him up to ask to hang out I’m too shy for that and even when the rare chance comes around to talk to him I definitely don’t take full advantage because I get super nervous around people I’m attracted to okay but the conclusion is that I hate catching feelings especially for someone I barely know or see. fuck crushes. \n",

If you keep on believing in yourself, at least in my experience, you will gain motivation again to do the work your depressed ass had no motivation to do before and procrastinated on. So instead of thinking about that crush, or friend that never messaged you back, or takes forever to respond and doesn't seem to give you back the attention you give them and you're sad about that, drop that shit.

Thankfully I'm done with that now but I literally have lab tomorrow where we're getting our next assignment which is due Monday. It apparently used to be easy but now we use a program called Snap made by people at UC Berkley. The program glitches a lot and has to be restarted all the time.

Finally, he has the courage to look me in the eye and ask for my information. We began talking and we sorta hit it off. We started to talk more and more until he made my insides start to tingle. It was a feeling so exciting that I could not shake off. One day we went to the visual arts restroom to make out and what not. We made out for a good 15 minutes. God, his soft big mushy lips felt so good against mine. I got too carried away and grabbed his crotch. I could see that he liked it because his cock was hard as a rock! I slowly gripped his erect cock and pulled his pants down. His Calvin Klein underwear revealed his massive latino bulge, and he was dripping with precum. I couldn’t control myself. I pulled down his underwear to view his beautiful erect uncut latino cock. I was so amazed and scared. I told him not to nut in my mouth because my stomach was being a bitch that day. I got down on my knees and sucked his cock until the next dimension. Time and space passed by like a second in that bathroom. He couldn’t control himself and he released his warm cum all in my mouth. I was upset. I was furious. He was still out of breath and had his eyes closed. I still had the warm juicy cum in my mouth. I stood up and popped his mouth open and fed his cum back into him. His face was one of shock. He couldn’t believe it. I walked away after that leaving him in his misery. I haven’t seen or spoken to him since. \n",

We both had feelings for each other at different points in time, and the timing just never worked out. I get to the point where I'm fed up with trying to date and I wonder if she's my soulmate. I wonder if, when I'm done with undergrad and grad school, I'll move back home and finally get a chance with her. I wonder if we'll be together for long, if we'll make our own wedding dresses, if our home will be filled with her artwork, if I'll get home from work and start painting with her or play video games like we always used to. I wonder if our art teacher would have guessed we would end up together, or if either of our parents had a feeling. I wonder if I'll keep forgetting how much I love her until I feel lonely, or if I'll never forget or be lonely again. I wonder if she thinks about this as much as I do, if at all.\n",

      "2928 This is in response to confession #11625 where OP wanted Asian Americans to \"acknowledge our privilege.\" I understand where you're coming from. I understand that the Asian community has a long ways to go to work on our anti-blackness (this for real is an issue, especially among older generations, so please @ my fellow asian americans help your parents, grandparents, etc. to understand!!). And I get that some people may perceive that systematic racism does not affect us as much as others, which, in some cases, is true.\n",
      "But, here's the thing:\n",
      "\"Asian\" is such a diverse term. When you say Asian, do you mean Laotian, Indian, Viet, Filipino, Chinese, etc.? Do you understand the difference in socioeconomic standing between south, southeast, east, and west asians? Why would you lump all of us into one group? Do you know what it's like to have your fellow POC not see you as a POC but for white people to still hold you beneath them because of some stupid model minority myth?\n",
      "Your perception of the Asian American community is only a fraction of our reality. Many of us have immigrant parents, who fled war or poverty, to come here (my dad left vietnam on a boat by himself when he was only 15). A lot of us have parents who can't speak english, parents who need you to translate things for them when you go out to the market, parents who don't know anything about college, so you have to figure it all out on your own, parents who don't get hired because their english is \"bad\". A lot of southeast asian americans work low income jobs: nail salon techs, supermarket employees, etc. It's demanding, tough work, and people don't respect them, just look at how often people mock nail techs.\n",
      "What you see about Asian Americans is only what the media portrays, what is barely skimmed over in American history books.\n",
      "You say you aren't going to deny that Asian Americans have faced discrimination historically, but you only mention dog-eating jokes and the fetish around Asian women, so I hope you also recognize that the historical discrimination of Asians goes beyond that. Chinese Americans were laborers who worked on the railroads in America in terrible conditions. Japanese American citizens were forced into internment camps during WWII bc white people thought they were \"spies\". Vietnamese Americans lived with 3 or more families in a home after fleeing the war. And even today, Asian Americans face discrimination that goes beyond some dog jokes: Southeast Asian gang members from the 70s/80s face deportation threats today: Trump is pushing for the deportation of Vietnamese Americans \"with a criminal record\" who came here before 1995, even if the crime they committed happened when they were teenage gang members in the 70s/80s, and so, so much more.\n",
      "But this isn't the oppression olympics. We shouldn't fight over who had it worse, but instead, recognize that each POC group has faced and continues to face their own struggle here in America. If we want justice, we have to stick and fight together.\n",
      "We have to realize the faults we've had to each other and work to improve our communities instead of tearing each other down. I can't speak for other POC groups, but as Asian Americans, this means we need to realize that our community is historically anti-black, don't fucking use the n-word because it's \"cool\", educate yourself and your family and friends, make our community better--not bitter.\n",

There's always someone that has to \"check their privilege\" or has to acknowledge and then be lectured on how fucked up their particular situation is. Now I could use my imperfect background to justify and support my thoughts here (A common tactic in this kind of culture) but I'm not going to.

Your post on how Asian Americans only feel discrimination in the form of things like jokes PROVES you have no grasp on history at all and is just dumb in fucking general as you essentially preach fucking more tolerance for African Americans and Latinix people then write a horribly intolerant post. I'm a member of Nikkei Student Union, the Japanese American club on campus, and when I was told many people didn't really know about Japanese internment I didn't believe them but obviously it's true. So here's a little education for you:\n",
      "Japanese internment camps was a knee jerk reaction of fear and racism. After Pearl Harbor was bombed by the Japanese, many Americans started to have this logic, if you're Japanese you must be a spy. So President Franklin D. Roosevelt himself signed executive order 9066. Where 120,000 Japanese people were sent to concentration camps in the US for two and a half years corcing them to leave their lives and belongings behind. Keep in mind roughly 80,000 of these people were CITIZENS OF THE UNITED STATES and the US betrayed them and said, \"No you guys are second class citizens\". On top of that martial law was enacted in Hawaii to specifically target Japanese who lived there.

Then it seems people like you seem to forget/ignore this horrible atrocity. Which shows another thing about Asian discrimination you completely ignore. We are fucking forgotten.

That doesn't change the fact that I'm in love with a boy and have the sweetest relationship right now, because we don't put an emphasis on sex. If sex is a really big part of what you want, then it requires more talking, but romantic feelings can go a long way.\n",

I have a really hard time in group tutoring because most often, and especially in my current workshop, it seems like the people there already understand, and I am the only one there to actually get help because I NEED it. I know that tutoring is also beneficial to strengthen understanding but it just gets frustrating being the one in the room who really just doesn't know. Before you all start dropping suggestions, and just saying I should study more, trust me, I know. I did and continue to use my resources. I know TLC has one to one tutoring for smaller intervals at a time, and that there's the math open house within the engineering department, but I just felt the need to get it off my chest that these structures, while they may work for others, and are proven to be helpful, just aren't really helpful for me. :(  \n",

I don't devalue how much they've been hurt. Why? It doesn't make sense to do this in general. You argued because of income and education rates, but trust me not everyone is the same. It's a generalization to believe there aren't wealthier POC or that some POC have no access to better education. As well as there are also Asian Americans living in these bad areas as well. I understand what you're saying to an extent, but I see it as an issue for people in general to be living in drastically different areas based on wealth.

I’ve been having some relationship issues (we’re working it out), but I feel like I can’t even talk to anyone about it. School is so stressful. I feel like I’m so freakin behind all the time and I need to be doing more volunteering, research etc. How is everyone managing it all?? On top of that I’m having an existential crisis. This past year I went through a lot...I’ve been in therapy trying to process but therapy has only been okay. What happened changed me a lot...it came to the point where I couldn’t be who I used to be. Now I don’t know who I am anymore. The only thing I seem to have control over in my life is my career/school but thoughts about the future give me so much stress and anxiety I can’t even sleep sometimes. Everything’s changed so much.

And I never had any sort of romantic feelings for her and the thought of it sickens me, because she has a boyfriend (who is also my friend) who I genuinely think is the best guy for her. The problem is that, for some god-forsaken reason, I get really attracted to her every time we talk for an extended period of time, and I hate it. There's just something about her that turns me on so much, it's not just her looks, it's everything about her, even the way she makes eye contact with me is both intimidating but also inexplicably turns me on. The fact that she mentioned that she's a dom in one of our conversations also doesn't help either. I know for a fact that she doesn't do this on purpose, and I also don't intend to act on these feelings ever. I just want to find a way to stop feeling overwhelmingly aroused every time I talk to her. It's genuinely distracting and makes me act like a bumbling fool when she's with me. I still want to talk to her just because our conversations are always interesting, but how do I keep myself from feeling this? I genuinely want to keep talking to her, not because of my attraction, but because our conversations are truly enjoyable without the whole attraction thing. It's just something about the way she carries herself, that makes me both scared and attracted to her. It's so weird. I'm not a small guy and I'm barely fazed by anything, but somehow this 5´3 girl makes me act like an absolute idiot by just looking at me.

There is a group of kids that have started coming out to play almost every day in the afternoon and they are so LOUD. I don't know if they are from the same family or a group of neighborhood kids but they will run up and down the street screaming at the top of their lungs for a few hours almost every day. Their parents are sometimes outside with them but they don't seem to care that they are being so loud. What should I do about it? I don't really know which house these kids live in so I can't really approach their parents and the adults are only around sometimes while the kids are playing. Can I file a noise complaint online? Would it even be taken seriously? I don't know how well a college student submitting a noise complaint about loud children would be received coming from a family-oriented neighborhood. Should I just move away? Advice please!\n",

I remember I didn't know what to say and just stood there embarrassed. She let me off the hook by saying I could tell her anything. After months of keeping it to myself and growing closer, I had enough and finally told her how I felt. But man, what every teenage boy fears when talking to a girl of their interest slapped me in the fkn face. The Friendzone boys. :) And I thought it was just a myth.

      "\n",
      "I'm an international student and I want to put this out there because as much as most Americans know what to do in these situations given recent events, many internationals don't because we haven't been exposed to this or taught how to do this. I also don't wanna assume all americans know what to do in one of these events, so this is just a general post to anyone who wants to feel more informed. I've gotten this info from research i've done myself, and most of my sources agree on the same things.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. AVOID - if you hear something that sounds like gunshots, don't hesitate or wait around for other people to act. Take action and protect yourself - if there is no risk in the way, GET OUT OF THE ZONE AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. Notify others, or take others with you. Always know your exits, wherever you are. LEAVE EVERYTHING. You may want to text your family saying you're ok, but reality is you're not gonna be ok until you're off the shooter's range. Once you're outside and safe, call people - police, 911, family members, friends, etc. Prevent people from entering the area. \n",
      "\n",
      "2. DENY - If you can't exit the area, you must find a place you're gonna take shelter and deny the shooter. Eg. if shooter is in the hallway and you're inside a classroom, EVERYONE must act quickly and block the door with as many things as possible- chairs, tables, you can even get creative and use stuff like belts, books, or everyone's backpacks. Do so and then find shelter inside the classroom, stay away from the door as the shooter might start shooting through the door. Turn off all lights, stay away from doors and windows to avoid being seen. Your job here is to make it difficult for the shooter to catch targets. Remain quiet, put your phones in silent mode. You might be hiding but be prepared to fight should the shooter enter the room. \n",
      "\n",
      "3. DEFEND - If you are unable to exit or prevent the shooter entry to where you are, this is your last resort. Think of this: he's one shooter with a gun, but you are probably a lecture hall of 100+ students. Be committed to fight back. If one person fights back, the shooter will probably take him down. If 20 people fight back, say by throwing stuff, he stands less of a chance. You can throw furniture, books, tables, laptops, maybe you create a distraction plan while waiting for him to come. Your goal is to disarm and take down the shooter. If you manage to disarm him, DON'T KEEP HOLDING THE GUN. Throw it across the room if you can. Police will come in looking for the person with the gun, you don't wanna be arrested when you in fact disarmed the shooter. The more the people who fight back, the greater the change of survival. Of course 300 people throwing books at one guy could get messy, but everyone can do something, plan something out if you have the time. The shooter is not expecting anyone to fight back, let alone a whole class of students. Use this to your advantage and catch him off guard. Also, be loud and aggressive. Might sound stupid, but it could intimidate the shooter if a class of 100+ people come at him all at once. \n",
      "\n",
      "Feel free to add anything else, this is obviously not the only way to survive, and none of these will ensure 100% survival from a shooting, but it increases your chances. Remember, in any emergency situation, the faster you act the higher the chance of surviving you have. Don't hesitate. This could happen at any moment, and I feel everyone should be aware and know what to expect and what to do. If possible don't leave this in the confessions page, share this info around, if something ever happens we might be able to save a lot more lives. \n",

That one hour I feel somewhat good about myself is when I get to see my penis will peeing, taking a shower, or sleeping naked. I really wish I wasn’t such a depressed and lonely person with an ugly personality, because then I’d be able to share my beautiful penis with other people. Can any data science majors start a research project and calculate the average penis size at UCSD so I can compare and feel good about myself? Thanks\n",

      "3112 I purposely make myself very busy so I’m not lonely. I was very depressed my sophomore year of high school because I felt like I had no friends (hindsight says otherwise 🙄) and the only thing I had going for me was classes and no extracurriculars. Naturally, I got really bad junioritis and joined almost everything at my high school. I managed to survive with only one anxiety attack and only moderate burnout come May. But you know, sometimes loosing your shit is better than constantly feeling like death so that means I have very terrible coping skills and have way over done it this year at college because I can’t say no. I get anxiety over saying no to things and will work myself to a break down to remain constantly busy. Obviously that’s not healthy or sustainable. I’ve let go a few of my extracurriculars in college in order to make time for classes. It’s just nights like these where I feel the slight pull of the depression I felt sophomore year of high school where I have nothing to do and it seems like no one wants to spend time with me (and I know all I gotta do is ask around and I’ll find plenty of other bored people to hang out with). Hopefully I can adjust to this transition without wanting to actually die in order to maintain a workload I can actually handle and spend time doing not important but very fun things with people I don’t get to see enough. People always ask me why I’m so busy all the time and I’m always afraid to answer truthfully: I keep myself busy to convince myself I have friends when I definitely do and to distract myself from the more lonelier parts of life.\n",

I'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to anyone.\n",

None of you thought it was weird that he DMed random girls who liked his overheard posts? Oh that’s right. You were all so quick to support him because he said he has autism. Supporting people in their comedy endeavors is so important don’t get me wrong; and memes are a great way to gain group acceptance. But y’all, red flags and unwelcome, creepy DMs to girls who just happen to like his posts, are still red flags. No one is exempt from being an internet troll and a creep. A nice story about an autistic guy using comedy for acceptance isn’t necessarily true on the internet. And the girls he DMed, myself included, did not know him and did not care to talk to him, since he was a stranger on the internet. So many people just lifted this guy up out of no where and didn’t look to see “wait who are you actually?” Stay woke. The PC sob stories get old real fast and mostly aren’t even true. \n",

I found a new (and better) group of friends, I realized the value in myself again once I became single (even though i should have known my worth regardless, oof), and I somehow managed a 4.0 gpa last quarter for 19 units worth of classes while balancing org and work responsibilities.

It’s so disappointing because those of us outside the major who are trying our best to cause change with the least amount of danger and highest intent of reward are shut down for trying to APPLY the shit they’re talking about, but never ever “get it” in their eyes. My efforts aren’t dampened nor are my goals deterred, but y’all need to stop acting like the sanctified gatekeepers, judges, and juries of policy application you think you are. THAT’S WHY THE ONLY OTHER PEOPLE THAT TAKE YOU SERIOUSLY ARE OTHER ETHNIC STUDIES MAJORS.\n",

Having to deal with all the academics, the pre-med extracurricular work, and my dysfunctional family dynamics at the same time has caused my health to deteriorate without precedent. My prime example is my gums: ever since freshman year they've started receding like mad. I've had two dentists tell me nothing is wrong with me and that it's a result of my orthodontic treatment (my braces) in high school. But I'm paranoid and I fear I actually have periodontal disease or gum disease. It must be the stress, which makes it so much scarier because college is always going to be a stressful time for me. So my gums will never stop receding. At this point my roots are becoming exposed, and I'm getting really scared. I'm gonna make one last appointment for an emergency exam and hope my dentist can refer me to a specialist and that my treatment is at least covered for the most part by my dental insurance. I already have so many problems and I don't want my teeth to be one of them.\n",

I stood there with my legs crossed, clenching my butthole as tight as I can and slowly shuffling my feet so I can get home in time before I shit my pants. It feeling went away so I began to walk normally then it hit me all of a sudden and when I tried to clench my butthole for a second time, I was too late and I shat myself. I gave up and sprinted home and went straight to the bathroom. I ended up throwing away my boxer briefs and I got shit over my white H&M pants that I bought recently.

Can I transfer to another uni under that major? Can I cry to coleslaw? How would I go about transferring? Are other engineering majors easier to get into? Is aerospace just as hard to get into as meche? If I get some godly prize or publication in an engineering journal would they let me in?

I just need help, I never thought college would be this impossible and I had so much hope going in undeclared. Freshman: if you’re undeclared and not valedictorian or very close DO NOT GO UNDECLARED trying to switch into a capped major.

I know college is suppose to be the best time of your life and that it only gets worse when you graduate, find a job, etc. but if this is the best it gets for me, I really don't see the point in life. Everyday is a combination of regret, loneliness, misery, anxiety, and depression. Some part of me knows it would be the \"right\" thing to reach out to people and try and make friends but the cautious side of me says how will things be any different from any of the other failed friendships you've had? I'm 22 and never been in a relationship with no one who would consider me a best friend. I have acquaintances but no real friends. Maybe having time for therapy after college will be a solution but for now, I can't help feeling like I just finished riding a roller coaster after waiting in a long line only to see everyone else around me, happy, with friends, in relationships, while I'm left sad and depressed. I can't help but feeling like there's something inherently wrong with me and that these things other people have, love, friendships, etc. are undeserved by me.  \n",

I am relatively flexible with where she wants to take things, but I also think that both of us are extremely busy people and may not have the time to take things forward either.

I’m fairly new to KOTX, and I consider myself as an introvert and someone who tends to be more quiet side. KOTX can seem a bit intimidating at first with a lot of people in the club who can be very flamboyant, and have loud personalities at times (not that it’s a bad thing, just something that can seem intimidating at first to an outsider or an introvert haha). The thing with KOTX, is that everyone in it is very good friends with one another and hang out with one another even outside of the club. I think it’s natural to walk in and feel a little out of place at first, but everyone in KOTX is very kind and welcoming. If you just go to a GBM and don’t put an effort to socialize and meet everyone, then that’s on you. If you come out to the social and dance events and put an effort to meet people, then they will also put an effort to get to know you too. Now I’m not saying you have to match their level of energy and enthusiam, because I certainly don’t at all times, but I’ve still managed to find my place here and I really love these individuals and this club. At the end of the day, each club has its own group and kind of people, and it’s normal to not vibe with each and every one. But to call the individuals and staff in KOTX as mean and isolating just isn’t true. \n",

We live in a society where we are trying to move towards women feeling comfortable rejecting sex in any situation possible and having their partner being okay with this. I'm in full support of this mindset. As such I also deserve the right to only consent to sexual situations I am comfortable with. Some people may have the preference to have sex with someone who is knowingly positive for herpes. I choose differently. This is not a decision that is up for debate because a decision to withhold consent is not debatable.\n",

      "6) The fact that I feel I need to defend myself not wanting to contract and deal with an STD is outrageous. Is it possible and normal to live a healthy life with herpes? Yes. But who the hell actually wants herpes? The real issue here is that I had a shitty and untrustworthy partner and somehow my views on consent and acceptance are being questioned. I'm the victim here. Not her.\n",

After not getting a response from my \"thanks for being cool about things, how's your break going if you don't mind me asking\" text, my first guess was that they felt uncomfortable telling me that continued friendship was out of the question after I revealed my feelings (and I didn't read them acting cool initially as their way of possibly making it easier due to my own lack of experience.) Still, they haven't deleted/unfollowed me, they're usually in the seen list on my stories (could just be a result of a skip showing as seen), and our common friends are not treating me any differently. We're both graduating in two months and the odds of us speaking to each other again after that are not even minuscule. For me, the thought of that fateful finals week marking the end of us knowing each other hurts, but that's probably just because I'm not jaded enough yet. I know that it's a bit selfish of me to see if we're still cool by going with a \"how's your quarter going\" message or just being honest about the thought I mentioned, but I'm considering it. I have gotten so used to letting things go unresolved because of being scared and taking the initiative to possibly get one last bit of closure might be a good step for me. On the other hand, it's also possible that I should just take this as my first definitive heartbreak, disassociate, and take note of what I learned for the future.

Simply because if you didn’t use it then you shouldn’t need to pay for it.

I’m a grad student living with 2 other undergrads. over spring break I stayed at the apartment while they both went home. I didn’t charge them for water/electricity for those 7 days even if “it’s not my fault they went back home.” Even if that was only  ~$10 discount, I still did what was right, which is to only charge them for what they actually used. They still paid full for rent tho even if they weren’t there because they still used the room/space and it’s a fixed price. \n",

We’re all capable of that, it’s really not impressive, or inspiring, or remotely necessary. It’s annoying. Do you know how many snap stories a day I have to skip through because of this? Or how many people from highschool I’m considering unfollowing because they suddenly believe a gym membership to 24 hour fitness makes them a fitness guru? Grow up, no one cares you go to the gym, maybe work on being an interesting person that doesn’t need to record the most mundane experiences of their life on camera.\n",
      "3325 I just want to hear what you guys think. What's the point of living if both being alone and being with friends is sad and depressing? Like sad being alone is obvious, but whenever I'm with friends I'm always jealous of what they are able to do and how much more successful they are in every aspect of their lives. Some of them have better GPAs, some of them are in great relationships, some of them are leaders in student orgs, and so on. It's not that I'm unwilling to explore new opportunities, it's that because of my depression I don't have the motivation for anything. It's just ranting and complaining every day. I hate living day-by-day like this. I'm putting on a smiling mask to everyone and just trying to be nice to them but I don't even know if I should expect them actually care about me (which to me is such a far-fetched idea). I mean I won't blame them for not caring about a trash guy like me, and honestly it would be better if I just disappeared. There's also the issue of them telling to do this and do that, you know, the positivity and exploration argument that everyone's heard of, but they just don't work on a person like me who doesn't have the motivation for any of that. They ask me what I stand out in, but isn't that a stupid question when you just know in your heart that you don't have anything to stand out in because you're literally at the bottom of the society? I'm tired of them always saying the same thing, while at the same time I know they're tired of saying those things to me knowing that I won't get it. Yes I really don't get these advice, because we're not in the same social status. They are of heaven, and I am of hell. If that loop of stubbornness and denying is always going to repeat, and nothing, not even a therapist, can do anything to change that, then what even is the point? I don't think there is one. \n",

I remember seeing one group on triton day and I immediately when to their booth or tent or whatever its called lol and was immediately ignored. I was told to just fill out stuff on a laptop and the people went back to talking to their other friends behind the table. I ignored that and hoped maybe things would be different if I went to the GBM. Nope same thing. I thought okay it's because I am an introvert and just don't vibe with these people. that's okay.\n",

      "I tried joining another org (which I've realized that it's a good thing I didn't join not gonna call peoples directly out cause that aint cool) and that didn't go so well.

The food wasn't even the main reason I showed up like actually the org was full of people who I thought I was gonna really vibe with but again guess not. \n",

So, me being the introverted and anti-social af person I am, was surprised that I went to their bonfire. And even more shockingly was warmly welcomed and even met some of my close friends there.

      "In this day and age, going outside is sometimes risky.  A new thing that’s been going on is people getting into fake Ubers and getting assaulted.  As a result I feel the need to make a PSA on how to avoid having that happen to you\n",
      "\n",
      "1) Alright so the first tip is pretty straightforward.  So every car has these plates on the front and back with numbers and letters identifying them called “license plates”.  Now not many people know this but Uber actually displays the license plate of the car that’s meant to pick you up.  So what you want to do is when you’re about to get picked up, you open the Uber app, look at the license plate of the car of your driver, then look to see if the car you’re about to get into has that number.  If you do this I can guarantee you’ll get into the right car every time.\n",
      "\n",
      "2) Now let’s say that’s a bit too difficult for you.  Maybe you’re here going “Are you serious?  7 digits and letters?  I can’t remember those:” well the good thing is I have another failsafe tip.  In addition to giving license plate numbers, Uber actually provides you with the physical appearance of the car.  So if for whatever reason you can’t compare license plate numbers, you can just look to see if the car you’re getting into matches the description of the car on the app.\n",
      "\n",
      "3) Alright this final tip is actually quite complicated and should only be used as a last resort should the first two methods fail.  So if the license plate trick and the car trick both don’t work you’ll have to do a visual comparison of the driver.  First you look at the pic of the driver in your Uber app then look at the driver of the car you’re about to step into.  If they look like the same person then get in.\n",

To everyone who says otherwise, let me ask you then. Let’s say you are dining out with a friend and your friend orders a premium steak and a drink while you only ordered fries. Would you think it’s fair for the bill to be split 50/50 instead of only paying for what you ordered?\n",

      "3503 To my friends, I am the kid who has gone through a lot and tries hard, but I still keep a lot to myself. I regained the ability to cry last year, and since then, I rarely go more than a week without crying. I have trouble falling into a deep sleep and usually can't fall asleep until 3 at the very earliest, an issue which probably doesn't help low moods (likely related, though.) For a while, depression and burnout from life in general had kind of taken away my ability to feel sad. Self-loathing bred passive resignation, particularly in regards to whether I was capable of being loved or receiving affection. Now, though, matters of love are playing a part in my becoming reacquainted with sadness. When I see people in relationships, I yearn for the little things. My suite-mate and their SO brush their teeth together, often laughing alongside each other. I don't want to admit it, but my heart kind of hurts when I see it. It's not a feeling of resentment, just a sense of sorrow about not sharing that bond with another person. I don't care about holding hands for appearances sake (showing someone off to aid my ego), but I yearn for the feeling of knowing someone who would see my hand as one worth holding. Trying to do little things to put myself out there, but I don't know how to not look distressed. I cherish my friends and like what I do, so I have other sources of refuge to help me as I work through a lot of underlying issues at least. It doesn't make the loneliness any less painful, but I know that it is okay to feel sad and I'll take sadness over bitterness or self-pity any day. \n",

They broke up and our friendship became closer but while I knew that her character (like ambition or empathy levels) wasnt the best fit to mine (I would care too much she would care too little about things; I loved to try new things she hated doing that stuff) our hobbies and everything else matched and we've had lots of fun times and laughed together. When we first met we had an almost fwb start; we didnt have sex or anything but I've felt up her boobs and she's touched my dick and we enjoyed cuddling a lot. Then we stopped once she got a boyfriend but we still maintained our friendship. I feel that now that I've known her for so long, I've grown past the lust part of our friendship and love her wholeheartedly. Sometimes though, when she talks about getting another boyfriend, I catch myself thinking \"I can be your ideal boyfriend.\" But realistically I know that our relationship wouldnt last because our personalities are so different and I'm also scared to tell her because I dont want to ruin what we have; it's gotten me through a lot and she's really been a beacon of support, despite how many times I have to bother her to try going out her comfort zone or to even help me with a chore here or there. It's tough because other than the personality clashes, she's my ideal type and I just love *her*. I love her smile and how her eyes light up; how elegant she looks when she crosses her legs. I love how she can be totally wacky and say some really random things sometimes and how we can laugh about the weirdest stuff together. But I know if we were to get into a relationship I've friendzoned myself so hard at this point that it's would be completely one-sided. I used to see her message her boyfriend all thr time and she would be sending him pictures and videos and messaging him all the time. I dont think she would go as far for me. Like yes I do get stuff, but not to the same level as her boyfriend, whom she loved. After they broke up, when she talks about her I get a little uncomfortable because one, ik she be lying cuz I talked to the dude, and we're homies and some things did not actually happen lol. But also it was just weird but not painful to picture her together with him. So I'm very confused about my feelings.\n",

Idek why its dry, maybe i should drink more water.. i use dove body wash for my vag too but i cant imagine it is thaaat drying, plus Ive been using that for a while. but mann it hurts when i open up my legs to pee, it hurts when the pee runs over my dry outer lips bc i literally bleed.. it hurts when i wear some underwear bc chafe is SO REAL, plus my lips are a little bigger so the material that lies outside is always sooo dry. It doesnt hurt during sex ONLY if im more than adequately wet. Otherwise, if my boyfriend grabs my ass or spreads my cheeks, my VAG LIPS SCREAMMM in agony omg.... like I literally bleed, i have an open wound down there! Ive been using lube but its more slippery than hydrating.  Also I'm 100% serious and I really am a girl lol and its been happening for a little but only getting worse/it doesn't get better over time anymore so ahhhhh ! Less sex isnt helping, idk if i should... moisturize down there..? Real advice pls <3\n",

      "3589 It's my first year living off campus and I was hoping to see how everyone else divides their utilities because my roommates and I couldn't come up with an agreement. I live with 4 other people and basically two of them are at the apartment all the time and the rest of us are not at the apartment 90% of the time. I only have classes M-TH and I have a job so I really only go to the apartment to sleep and shower. Also, I go home every Friday-Sunday since I don't live too far away. On top of that, they also have guest over most of the time so their guests obviously also use our utilities. I pitched in the idea of just dividing the bill by the days that each person was at the apartment, but the 2 other roommates complained how unfair that is and said that it's not their fault that I go home every weekend blah blah. However, I feel like it's also unfair on my end to pay for the days that I was not even here. So if anyone knows a good compromise to my situation, please leave a comment. Thanks!\n",

After that they all go into their little groups and I’m left alone. I consider myself an extrovert so it’s not because I’m unable to put myself out there, the club’s staff is hard to approach.

The weird thing was she told me almost exactly where she lived (the floor and what her suitemates looked like) I’m guessing she was so tired of dining hall food that she had to resort to stealing wallets to buy real food. The only problem was that a lot of my highschool friends go to UCSD and I contacted all of them. I got my wallet back before the 5 RAs and 2 RSOs showed up by going door to door and eventually her suitemate got it back for me. At this point it was 12 am and I wanted to go back home, the only problem is the 5 RAs demanded her name and room #, while usually I’m all for retaliatory punishment I wasn’t in the mood to put someone who just got caught with a hand in the cookie jar. I knew what it’s like be desperate for money. Unfortunately because of this I was forced to stay until 4am waiting for the campus police, and when he arrived he let me leave immediately because I didn’t want to press charges.

      "3676 Ever have a crush on someone but then have the higher powers that be that controls our fates, interactions, and destinies (whichever one it is) make it soul-crushingly hard for you to actually reach out to them and get to know them better? A short time ago, I fell fairly hard for this lady who I see precisely twice a week for a total of four hours per week. She is a (very senior) member of the club I am in and I never ever see her anywhere outside of club meetings ever. We never really talk during the club meetings because most of the biweekly two hour meetings are devoted to club business and because she typically walks in late and/or leaves immediately after the meetings end. And when we do have free time before/during/after the meetings themselves, I never really have an opportunity to engage her because she's typically engaged with all of the other senior club people (since they're all really close friends outside of the club) and it would just be horribly awkward and rude if I cut off or butted into their conversation. We share no classes together, nor do we ever bump into each other on campus, so there's never really been a chance for spontaneous conversation to occur. I've never been particularly concerned about initiating and maintaining the conversation, since I'm a pretty good conversationalist and so is she (from what I can infer) and we both have fairly similar interests (more similar than practically all my previous crushes). We're also connected to one another on Messenger and Instagram, but I sense I wouldn't have much success by going the inbox route, since she is busy ad perpetuum (coursework, club work, and work work too, I'd presume). Also I haven't the slightest clue about where I'd even begin, how I'd initiate conversation online considering we still don't know each other very well (although luckily we aren't strangers). At this point, I don't know what to do. I feel like I've reached my wit's end. It's gotten to the point where I am beginning to fervently hope/pray for some kind of break, anything at all, any chance encounter or opportunity anywhere. I understand that things like this happen and them's the breaks, but it's still so incredibly frustrating. Irrespective of what happens though, I'm still gonna shoot my shot, since I haven't a thing to lose by doing so. And I understand that irrespective of how much foundation I build up between her and myself, she may still shoot me down for reasons that are totally beyond my control (or alternatively, she may accept simply out of interest). It's just that I want to reduce the probability of being shot down (however great that may be) as much as possible (however much that amount may be). I'm not asking for anything from you, fine folks of the Confessions community, but I'd truly appreciate any words of encouragement or support or any advice or input.\n",

      "I am working on starting a new student publication and am recruiting a staff or contributors to write about the question of what it means to be a college student.\n",
      "College appears singular and monolithic to those who are outside of it. Unavoidably, we hold this viewpoint before we enter college, and often pick it up once again after we have long forgotten about all of our experiences. For four years, however, we know that the collegiate experience is ultimately a complicated, holistic and imperfect process.\n",
      "We can pen a deeper reflection of all the personal stories, ideas, and experiences which come together and describe the college experience. What are those issues which make college at UCSD unique? To me, this ends up being Geisel, food, our international student body, and our (soon to be) seven colleges: we seem to be cursed with bad food on our campus, I wonder if our large international student body obligates us to greater degrees of inclusion and integration, and finally, how will the Chancellor’s plans to eventually guarantee four-year housing change campus life?

      "3699 It makes me sad when people I know who don't have dream-level GPAs (3.6, 3.7, etc.) think less of themselves and believe they have no chance of pursuing their dreams. This school has a way of normalizing every individual into a number and spitting out odds of getting into graduate school, a career, etc. Is it good to be realistic and pragmatic? Without a doubt. Is it good to let statistics and averages determine whether or not you can do something? I'm not so sure. There's a reason interviews and essays exist; every individual is a unique human being that has capacity to contribute, and no amount of grades or test scores can hamper that.\n",

      "3700 Continuation of #10893: To clarify, getting good grades and having a high MCAT score is important, no doubt. Academics are the basis of any graduate school and are important. But those two things by themselves don't make you stand out in any capacity, because like I said, most applicants all have great scores. Medicine is about so much more than just being \"smart\"; you're devoting a huge chunk of your life (arguably your prime years) to helping people (note this is not restricted to pre-meds, this applies to nurses, midwifes, public health majors, etc.  ). If you're going into healthcare, you need to be a well-rounded and passionate individual; again, good grades and MCAT in this example are great, but not sufficient. I feel like I came off as a butthurt jealous pre-med so I should clarify my GPA is about average and my MCAT score is above average, so I'm no academic stud myself. Despite that, I devoted a LOT of hours pursuing projects and organizations that I am passionate about and love spending time on.\n",

Recently, I'm particularly interested in one guy who is pretty new to tinder. The first time we met, we got to know each other, and I was a little surprised to hear that he didn't have that much experience with sex. Like Idk, he's a solid 8 or 9 and he's a whole foot taller than me. Anyways, after we had sex, he told me that he really liked being with me and that he didn't want to just leave right after because he didn't want me to feel used. When he said those words, it really made me happy because I just want a relationship with some substance. Of course, it's too soon to say that we'll turn into something serious, but him saying that gave me a lil hope. \n",
      "He's also super affectionate, and I kinda forgot how much I liked hugs and soft pecks until he came along. Actually, I tend to be uncomfortable/tense around new people, but I feel very comfortable with him physically. Like his embrace is just very comforting and addictive. SO the combination of the fact that we vibe pretty well, his particularly pleasant affection, and his somewhat wholesome intentions has got me pretty hooked. \n",
      "3 or 4 days after we meet, he hits me up first and we end up talking and cuddling for a few hours. He tells me that he got out of a relationship before spring break, and he kinda told me that he didn't think we were anything serious. Idk if he meant that he didn't want to, but yea it was a little discouraging ngl. BUT I can understand why he's more hesitant to jump into something. He did share that he just hated being lonely, so I think we're on the same page in that sense. After that, we rambled on about other stuff, and he started to get sleepy. He really wanted me to stay the night, but I wasn't down because I had an 8 am. He told me again that he thinks that we get along really well for some reason. Before I left, he hugged me for a long time and told me that he liked being with me.\n",
      "Since then, I can't get him out of my mind. Like damn I don't wanna be a sucker for words, but now I smile whenever I think about him. Despite all that sweet stuff, I am also trying to not be invested in case he loses interest and finds another girl. This has happened to me two or three times, so I'm just worried that this is gonna be that same situation. I want to keep seeing him, but I'm feeling insecure about us as well.\n",

So what I did was I played around with her, and tried writing things with the same strategies and noticed that all it took was relating to how things are either problems for women, or problems for Asians. The reason for this strategy was because I believed that she would appreciate me exaggerating women's problems that don't really exist, and that she felt she couldn't challenge me on my bullshit because she doesn't know what it's like to be Asian. and sadly to say it did work. and just to really confirm it, I tried one paper where I actually did read the readings, and objectively wrote about it and then changed gears and undermined the women's issue that was being discussed, and got a bad score on it. \n",

And this guy came into the room, saw me was by myself, came to me, just being nice and trying to make me feel comfortable in the situation as a member of that fraternity.  Fast forward, I didn’t join the fraternity but something else happened yet nothing else actually happened. In that school year, every time I saw him on campus, I blackout which made it so weird. That’s also why I never talked to him after the event. Then fall quarter came, I totally forgot about him. One day I was walking uphill and he was walking downhill, before I thought of anything, there’s this firework show immediately started in my mind when I saw him. Just like I don’t even remember what my friend’s dad looks like but once I saw his pic, my brain started to produce saliva because he made me delicious bbq lamb ribs before. Oh well, I got this huge smile on my face came from nowhere and I just don’t wanna it get any more weird so I quickly turned it to a poker face, pretended I didn’t see him and quickly passed him which still made it worse because we already saw each other at the time. Worst part came, he kept pop up in my mind. Like, annoyingly you know. I worked really hard to convince myself not to do that by giving myself a long prep talk and I made it! \n",

That's all fine and dandy but whenever we go grocery shopping together or even when I am in the kitchen cooking something, they will pick up some of my food and look at the nutrition facts. If the food is particularly healthy, they will say how low calorie the food is but when something isn't up to par with what they consider healthy, they will just set it back down and not say anything. I am of average weight and am generally healthy but I did have an eating disorder in my younger teens which involved starving myself to lose weight. I have been struggling with binge eating so far since the start of this year and I am just now getting into a more stable, non-disordered eating pattern but every time this person does this, my mind slowly starts to have those bad thoughts again and I really don't know what to say about it. I know they are not doing it intentionally, in fact, they might even be struggling with their own form of disordered thinking when it comes to food. I don't want to make a big deal out of it but I also want them to stop. What should I do/say? It's getting to the point where I don't even want to cook anything at home anymore to avoid being judged and eating out is just not in my budget anymore, financially or emotionally. Please help.\n",

All my friends are Asian, and sometimes they will all agree that I’m doing something the wrong way and their way is the right way and better, even though the thing I may be doing in that moment doesn’t affect them. There have also been a few times about them talking about how courteous they are because their parents are so strict and they take pride in the fact that their childhood was tougher and they got slapped growing up and things like that. I know not everyone here is like that but I have gotten a general vibe from the people around me that they think their culture is superior. They’ve said they like how I’m open minded and willing to try things their way and am open to their culture, but then they aren’t open to how I do things. Once one of them insulted white people for saying Korean Shirt rubs in English while they were at trader joe’s. If you can’t speak Korean and you live in an English speaking dominated country it should be ok to say it in English. Not to mention if they did say it in Korean they’d be criticized for not pronouncing or saying it correctly. Anyways that’s the end of my rant sorry it was long.\n",

One of them liked me, I tried letting him down nicely and curving him pretty obviously, and when I eventually flat out rejected him he was all “_______ is a bitch, she’s a hoe anyways, she wears too much makeup i probably wouldn’t recognize her if we were dating and she got too comfortable and showed me her bare face” etc etc. really mean and hurtful things, and it influenced the way the other guys in our friend group saw me and they all stopped talking to me. \n",

      "3797 To whoever keeps posting things about what fat girls should and shouldn't do, honestly there are other ways that you can make yourself feel good, you don't have to insult others anonymously just because you're insecure. It's crazy to me that something someone does that affects you so little upsets you enough to post on here, even if you're trying to do it in a funny or joking way to avoid criticism. It's so rude, there's  a lot of people out there who feel awful when they don't deserve to because of people like you who for some reason care about these things. Not everyone has had the privilege of being able to develop a good self esteem and being able to feel good about themselves in general. Please understand, maybe it seems like some sort of joke to you, but to a lot of people it isn't. I don't want to make any statements about whether being fat is healthy or not, but if you see someone who is obese or overweight walking around, it really doesn't affect you, so please stop with these comments, they are rude and obnoxious, and people can do what they want.\n",

I am a smart woman, I am driven, and I always actively work on bettering myself. It is not difficult for me to casually date people or hook up with guys. What is difficult though, is finding a guy who feels the same way I feel about him. Too many times I’ve fallen for a guy who just saw me as another girl he doesn’t take seriously because he wants to fuck around. It makes me question myself and it gets to my self esteem.

It was like a \"shot\" in the \"dark\" of all the loneliness and stress I was feeling. We've met before but I didn't really feel a connection back then (and I didn't see how our schedules would allow things to work out). So, I instead worked on improving myself and put myself out there more. Being a new quarter, I felt rather hopeful at our following meetup, but she seemed WAY MORE occupied, especially with an SO who took her out often. At the moment, I was stunned because I didn't know whether to still try to spend time getting to know her despite her SO or to move on completely (which is what I did and felt was the better option). Despite all of that, I'm starting to feel better that you're enjoying the college life and if you see this, I hope you're doing well!\n",

He used to call me and we’d see each other maybe up to three times a week but he hasn’t called or texted me lately. I really shouldn’t care because we’re not anything serious, but I just can’t shake the insecurity of the type of “relationship” we have. I also have a tendency to fall for others pretty easily.\n",

The only thing is that my last relationship lasted a long time, a few years. We broke up almost a year ago, but for some reason, I'm still comparing the new guy to my ex. I know it's a terrible habit. I am completely over my ex, he has a new gf and honestly, I would never get back together with him. I just feel guilty always comparing any new relationship to my past one. Maybe it's because my past relationship was all I've ever known so it's normal to think of him when a new guy comes along. Honestly, I have no idea what to do or if this is normal and any advice or kind words would be greatly appreciated. \n",
      "3947 Autistic person here (not in the way that edgelord assholes mean, can't believe people still say that shit in 2019.) Reading rooms and cues is something that I have to constantly practice, so I veer towards over-analysis and being cautious as a general rule of thumb. This keeps me out of sticky situations, but it also deters me from taking potentially positive risks. I have some great friends, but my circle is relatively limited and I am not one to put myself out there. After getting past the mental hurdle of telling someone else that I have feelings for them (didn't work out and that's okay), I have found myself feeling noticeably more attracted to people in general and it's really confusing. My game-spitting skills are non-existent. I can't tell when or if someone is sending me signals and miss on potential opportunities to spark up conversations or flirt a bit. For example, a person smiled at me and said they recognized me from a class before asking me about how the final went, leading to a brief convo. They were really enthusiastic and I appreciated someone initiating a convo as simple as that, but I still came off as really shy throughout the interaction. Another time, someone poked me on the back to compliment me on something I was wearing and I said \"thank you\" with a smile before continuing to go about what I was doing. \n",

      "I am not particularly bad looking for someone so socially inept, but I worry that the combination of my shyness and my features make me look almost childlike. I feel like some people might read my shyness as an indicator of being asexual or aromantic, a feeling that only gets compounded when I tell them that I am on the spectrum. I recently created a tinder profile as a \"fuck it\" move, but I don't have any matches yet. My settings (within general campus/student life radius so it isn't all randos) may be contributing a bit, but it would suck if it's just that I am not drawing interest or am not cognizant of unreasonable standards that I might have. All of this is really confusing and I just wish I had the confidence to try earlier in life, rather than starting so late. Ugh. \n",

Because of this, I had some bouts of depression but I am over it. I know that it was up to me to try and meet people but talking to people is hard especially if you are scared of being judged or just not getting liked.

One shouldn’t have to “come out” of the closet and make an announcement about their sexuality like it’s a job or an engagement. Sexuality is something that you’re born with, so heteronormativity shouldn’t be the assumption. The reason I didn’t react to my brother coming out is because I don’t feel like he needed to “come out” to me as that would imply that the world expects him to be heterosexual. Did I do the right thing? I want everyone’s opinion on this but I will especially appreciate the LGBTQ community’s view on this.

I know some white people in KP don’t even know what kuya/ate/ading means and yet they wanna be one just for the party scene and fam line. Meanwhile, actual Filipinos are sometimes unable to be paired with a kuya/ate/ading. When will white people realize that not every Opportunity is for them to take lol\n",

I honestly laughed out loud when I realized that he thought I REALLY DID miss his average dick. He’s always been kind of an asshole so I don’t feel bad at all.... I never replied to him after he replied to my thirsty ass messages and now he won’t stop texting me and keeps asking me questions of when I’m going home and when is my spring break and random “?” messages etc. I don’t plan on answering him because I realize now that he’s still the same jerk and nothing has changed.

      "3990 The guy who talked about the wage gap between the sexes is correct but approached the topic without any tact and also comes off as kind of a douche with a superiority complex. There are a number of reasons that women are paid less than men. Part of it is an overall genetic predisposition towards careers that are people-focused over object-focused. Part of it is outdated oppressive tactics like a glass ceiling. Part of it is that men are willing to work longer hours and ask for more raises. So on and so forth. It's a complex, multivariate issue and causality is difficult to fully determine but simply shouting \"OPPRESSION\" is as non-sensical as those shouting that \"MEN ARE BETTER\". The issue with the left is that they completely throw out science when it comes to the topic of sex/gender differences and cling to JUST oppression, when the issue is much more complicated than that. Are women discouraged from going into the STEM field and managerial/executive positions? Yes, even though I think that this is decreasing over time. That's something that we're going to have to continue to flush out as a society. Are women also genetically predisposed to jobs that are valued less within this society? The answer is: YES. There are solid, time-tested research articles done demonstrating the fact that differences in occupation between the genders RISE when countries adopt more egalitarian policies that remove societal biases towards one occupation or the other. The more pressing issue that I think is often overlooked is: Are we undervaluing the positions that women tend to adopt in our society? I think we are. The real systemic bias lies in this issue. Why are elementary school teachers paid such dismal rates when they're educating future generations? Why are counselors paid such dismal rates when they're taking care of the mental health of current and future youth in a time of skyrocketing anxiety, depression and self-harm rates? THIS should be the focus of discussion because it addresses a large part of the wage gap that exists within this country without forcing a particular career choice for women. \n",
      "\n",
      "I think the wage gap between jobs is honestly overstated. Coming from a simple logical perspective, in a competitive economy, why would business owners hire men if they can pay women 78 cents to the dollar for the same value of work? Do you know how hard it is to start or even run a business? Do you know how much overhead that business owners could save by adopting to a female-only workforce if this was true? Let's re-introduce some reasoning into this argument because it's a damn complicated problem that won't be addressed by the fucking monkey approach we have now. Let's talk about the real issues and not parrot the oppression-narrative OR the male superiority-narrative. \n",

      "4044 Sometime ago took working out very seriously, I was a skinny guy trying to get more muscular. I would eat as much as I could, drown myself in protein shakes and workout religiously. And the best part was I was seeing great results, I was becoming more muscular and starting to fill out my cloths. But one thing no one ever tells you about eating a lot of protein or a lot in general is the incessant flatulence you accrue. Fast forward to the start of a quarter, I had a writing class around noon of that day so I figured I could get a quick workout in. I hit up Rimac, got that sick pump bro and went home as fast as possible to take advantage of that anabolic window. I sloshed together the most putrid yet protein and calorie dense shake UCSD has ever known. I pinched my nose and knocked back the vile gains elixir. I had 15 minutes left before the start of the writing class so I changed and ran over. I found a middle seat and the class started on time. The professor began going over the syllabus and eventually requested we write a little about ourselves and turn it in before leaving. It had been a little over an hour since I had the shake, and at this point my GI tract was wrenching, bloating, contorting and growing. I was immediately trapped. I was frozen in my seat; the reality of what may happen struck me all at once. I ordered my rectum to batten down the hatches, shut the sphincter, all hands on the poop deck. But it was to no avail, much like a failed 1 rep bench press max with no spotter I needed to bail out from under the barbell. In the complete silence surrounding me I farted with the combined energy of 10000 suns. It lasted for a complete 20 seconds, the class still in complete silence but the attention now all on me as if I was conducting a Ted talk. Once it had ceased, I collected my things, left the class, went home dropped the class and got a haircut. True Story.\n",

Over the years, I've gotten really close to them despite our 4-year age difference. All three of us are a really close family, I even spent all of my spring break over there. I have a very close relationship with the both of them. A couple days ago, after talking for multiple hours, her ex-boyfriend/current best friend confessed over the phone to me that he has feelings for me. He and I are really close now and he's known me since I was 14 years old. Though my sister recently came out to my mom, my whole family including my dad still thinks that they're a couple. My dad went to visit them last weekend during a work trip, and he still isn't aware of the situation. They've come to visit us in our hometown many times and my sister isn't comfortable yet with coming out to our family, plus everyone really loves her \"boyfriend.\" My sister was the only person he felt comfortable telling about his feelings towards me and we have yet to talk about it.

Basically, anyone who comes into my life and does something meaningful will get their song (or a bunch of songs if they're super special) and the lyrics or the mood of the song doesn't have to match what the person did. This also happens to me with places I visit, and any specific memories. It's so weird to the extent I might not have heard a song in 15 years and once I do, I remember exactly where I was when I heard it, when, what I was doing, as long as it's linked to a memory (eg roadtrip with my dad at night coming back from a certain place when I was 5). It's kinda cool if you ask me, but it can also get really bad an depressing. Eg. Not being able to dance to a song at the club because my memory linked to it would be of a guy I considered my friend sexually assaulting me. I will sometimes go in a restaurant and the background music will drive me to tears, or make me feel butterflies based on what is playing.

I was waiting for her to stand up, grab me, and walk outside to be with our mom. It never happened. We never talked about this night, but I can only assume she was waiting for me too. Dad finally turns around and tells us to not even dare help our mom. Neither of us did, and she was forced to sleep on the balcony stairs right outside the window of our room. All I could do was look up at the window from the floor. I couldn’t look any closer because I was too scared to see my mom actually outside. I stared at the window, the floor, the window, the floor, the window until dad finally laid his blankets on the floor right in front of me and fell asleep. This was the night I skipped all the indecisiveness, the reasoning, and the daydreaming. This was the night I went straight to the knife. \n",

We don’t say anything to each other, but we just look into each other’s eyes for a a few seconds. He’s the first guy I’ve ever fallen in love with. I fell madly in love with him and thought he was the one. We had all the perfect moments and he fell in love with me back...but it was freshman year and well he had a lot of girls on his mind and it didn’t work out. It completely wrecked me. It took ages for me to even be okay after it (despite us being friends for a long time after and me still being in love with him). I finally cut him completely out of my life for my sanity. We’ve never really talked since. We don’t even see each other. Our only communication now is checking each other’s socials when we post. Moving past all this, I’ve been in an amazing relationship for almost a year now. He’s the sweetest most amazing guy. He truly cares for me and loves me so much. It’s for this reason that I hate the fact that my ex is still in my dreams...I don’t know what to do. In real life, he rarely consumes my thoughts. I love the man I’m with now, I don’t want to go back to my ex at all but the love I felt for my ex was so strong. Nothing has ever consumed me so greatly. I just want him out of my dreams, out of my subconscious for good and I don’t know what to do. Any thoughts? \n",

      "4244 This is not a confession, but some advice I'd like to post for graduating seniors or anyone looking for a job, internship, etc.  I'd like to post it anonymously so that it doesn't seem like I'm bragging.  I keep seeing post about people applying to 30+ jobs and not getting interviews.  Honestly, that's likely your problem.  You need to be spending hours customizing each application so that it's clear that you don't just want a job, but you want that particular job with that company.  Show interest in the company and show why the company is not only a good fit for you, but why you're a good fit for them.  If you send in generic resumes/cover letters, then it's going to seem like you are just looking for money and will likely leave the company if given a better offer.  Depending on where you are applying, you may want to drop off resumes in person (especially if you are looking for a job where you would be working with customers).  Always look professional and ask to speak to a manager when dropping off the resume/cover letter.  When working over the summer, I got interviews at places I was nowhere near qualified to work.  Why?- because I had a good handshake, showed up in a suit, and showed interest in the company.  Smile too!  Too often I see people showing up to interviews in jean/without their shirts tucked in.  I graduated last year and got a job offer in the fall for $80/hour.  After being offered the position, I told the company that I'd have to think about it since I still wanted to look into other companies.  They then offered me $85.  (FYI I had no internships and only graduated with a 2.9 GPA).  Know your worth.  Play up your strengths and quantify your abilities on your resume if possible.  Also, study for your interviews!  If you can't do the harder problems, buy a book a study!  Chemists/biochemists- you should be able to make buffers!  CS majors- get a book of problems and work through them.  They will ask you similar problems.  There's only so many ways to solve these and you need to find the most efficient way.  Do practice interviews and study for your interviews like you studied for your tests.  Even better, study with friends.  If you're still struggling, consider working with a recruiter who can help prep you for interviews.  Always thank your interviewers for their time and be excited about the interviews/position.  Have your \"elevator pitch\" prepared and research the company.  Coming with questions/showing your knowledge about the company will show your interest. Spell check everything you send and have someone who knows your strengths look over it.  If you know someone good at grammar, ask him to read through your cover letter/resume.  Limit your resume to 1 page and use strong verbs on your resume.  Make sure you referrals know that you'll be using them as referrals (so that they can plan to say some nice things about you).  Don't lie on your resume! \n",
      " If there's a skill you think you need, learn it!  Some applications will require skills that no one has (like 10 years experience with a language that's been around for 9), so still apply even if you don't meet every requirement.   Also, quantify/qualify your experience/skills (X years experience, proficient vs. advanced, etc.)   Lastly, have a professional e-mail address.  If your e-mail address is something like \"babyboi420@_________.com\", then your resume is going to be trashed right away.  Be confident and good luck everyone! :)\n",

      "4271 I wrote confession 10587 about telling a tour group to not attend UCSD because they will regret it. In response to the 2 white males that were upset with what I said, you're right. Instead, I should have said, \"Don't come here if you're a low income minority because this school only favors you if you are white or wealthy or both.\" Honestly, I have never been so aware of colonization until I came to this stupid university. It is not a matter of taking advantage of opportunities or not, it is about the struggle with the financial aspect and the social climate, both of which have been consistently working against me. You would think that with the tuition we pay, the parking situation would be better and the food wouldn't be so damn expensive. If your parents can't afford to help you out, you are already obliged to have jobs while in school just to afford food and housing. Not to mention the social climate, I never met anyone with my same background. People always talked about how their parents went to college and are now doctors/engineers/insert other highly regarded career. I could never dream of joining a frat/sorority because it was so expensive. The pretentiousness and lack of empathy from other people from affluent backgrounds has made everything so much harder. In addition, I never once had a professor that looks like me. Even when you walk around campus, you see all the banners on those light posts with people's faces and most of them are white. It is easy to say, \"Oh, you just didn't take advantage of the opportunities\". Being so ignorant that you can easily say that sentence to someone without knowing their situation speaks volumes of the privilege that you have. You have no idea what it is like to be the first one in your family to do everything in this country and have no clue as to what you're doing, while constantly dealing with discrimination in the process. How about you check your white privilege and stop invalidating other people's experiences and emotions just because you are too privileged to even comprehend their viewpoint. Thanks.\n",

As a female who already struggles with working out in front of others, it is so irritating when another female comes and makes it harder for me to complete my workout. \n",
      "4273 I really hate it when chubby and fat girls call themselves “thick” and “curvy”. No you are fucking not. You’re a slob who overeats and you try to describe yourself with the same adjectives people describe beauties like Kylie Jenner and Rihanna. Real thick and curvy girls are girls who have small waists compared to their bust and hips. NOT girls with an obvious muffin top and bellies going past their boobs. Most of you wouldn’t even be thick or curvy if you were at a normal weight. I know this post won’t be very popular, and I don’t care; Americans need to stop promoting body positivity for obesity. It’s nasty, not sexy, and needs to be discouraged. I’ve seen you fatties eat and you all overeat. Eat like a normal human being and you won’t need to lie to yourself thinking you’re thick anymore. \n",

Now this person and I would spend large amounts of time together but I don’t think that’s the reason why I did poorly in my classes. What happened is that when I was trying to do homework or focus in lectures all I could think about was that person. I’ve been in relationships with people and I’ve had other crushes, just this one has really fucked me over. Now if my weird creepy obsessive phase lasted like a week or two whatever but this shit has been going on for TWO WHOLE MONTHS now and I’m worried. I’m worried for my mental and emotional health, and I’m also worried about my grades for this upcoming quarter. To me this screams “go to CAPS bitch” but like fuck. So many confessions about it taking weeks to get an appointment... that means I’ll still be out in the stars come first round of midterms. The main reason I don’t want to go is just it’s simply embarrassing that I can’t get myself together over one super obsessive crush.

But my friend went over there and asked and then dragged me over there and when I was talking to her, she seemed flustered and kept on turning to her friend and giggling? but I felt so uncomfortable despite the one asking questions and in the end I just left and I hated myself.

I really don't care if you smell like sweat, we are in a GYM but my god, whatever you were wearing was so pungent that I could barely resist the urge to gag. Did you really have to come use the treadmill right next to me? There were at least 5 other ones that were not being used. I had just broken a personal best time and I was really reluctant to end my run but after about 20 minutes, I was starting to get a headache from your stench. This isn't the first time this has happened either. Ladies, (guys too but I've only experienced this with females) if you are going to workout, PLEASE don't spray an entire bottle of perfume on yourself. Better yet, don't wear any perfume or scented products at all. It is so inconsiderate and makes it really hard to do cardio workouts because breathing obviously intensifies and having to breathe in your perfume each time makes it really hard to keep working out. If you can't stand the thought of smelling like nothing when going to a gym, then can you at least go do your workout away from other people so nobody has to smell it? Like at least spray an aromatherapy oil on yourself so I can at least feel relaxed when your stench particles violate my nostrils. \n",

Texting makes my anxiety worse, and the thought of a person possibly doing something like that is a big reason why.

I feel like my personal issues have been putting me down through the quarter since I felt like puking every other day and I ended up procrastinating on my work. At this point I feel like I lack the motivation of going on for a quarter since I'm paying for my own college and I keep failing and financial aid has its limits. My parents don't really push me to go on and told me it's up to me. They wanted me to go to cc anyway. I also don't know anymore if to either keep going in my major (even if I would love a job in that field) or change it to struggle less.

At the same time, I'm surprised I run into people I know often, given how big the campus is. Like I'd expect the chances to be smaller. Weird\n",

Unintentionally. It's not because I don't care or don't like you (we cool), but it's because I am near-sighted and I also admittedly have a slightly harder time recognizing people's faces. By the time I remember you it's too late. Even though I probably should, I don't wear contacts or glasses because I hate the feeling and find them uncomfortable.\n",

      "If you really wanted trump impeached. You could have done it a long goddamn time ago. And the evidence for his crimes is literally public knowledge. He made an executive airstrike that killed an American 8 year old girl. he broke the emoluments clause by keeping his hotels in international countries which were then used to meet for foreign affairs with foreign officials. He used campaign money to fuck a pornstar. \n",

      "The Russia investigation wasn't at all about impeaching him. It was about the Democrats not wanting to admit they lost to trump. Well you know what, let me say it. They lost. You lost.

The republican party threw the election running the dumbest fucking man to have ever attempted politics, and somehow the Democrats fucked up worse and got a person that not even the Democratic firewall was willing to vote for.\n",

What does that say about your candidate if all it takes is unverified facts to make 3 states that always voted Democrats to all of a sudden vote republican? That just means your candidate SUCKED. Now if you're convinced Russia rigged the actual counts of Cotes that's a different story. But if all they did was propagate false info and that's all it took to get a turd like trump to the office then you know what, you deserved it. If you ran a likable candidate instead of trying to run some power hungry lady that's just running because she felt it was \"her turn\" after Obama, you deserve the loss. And I don't say this as a republican or a Democrat or any political party. I say this as somebody who doesn't subscribe to a party and looks at politics from a neutral point of view, nobody deserves the horror that is Donald Trump but there is no doubt in my mind that the Democratic party dug their own grave running Clinton and that's nobody's fault but theirs.\n",

For more context, this girl that I was friends with in high school keeps messaging me to hang out and tries to be apart of my life. I feel bad for not valuing her as she does with me, it’s just all throughout our friendship in high school we fought a lot and she wasn’t a great friend. She wasn’t someone I wanted to continue being friends with past high school. I always reply to her messages but hours to days later and my replies are short and I always say I’m busy if she asks to hang. I reply out of courtesy because I would hate to not receive a reply.

      "4357 Hi y’all! I really don’t know how to start this and this has a bunch of topics going back and forth. It’s super difficult for me to make friends because I’m super quiet/introverted/socially awkward. I want to make more friends but idk how too. It's really difficult for me to talk to others because I’m not sure what to say. I feel so lonely. I feel like I don’t fit in. I always feel left out by my suite-mates and I feel that no one, not a single person legitimately likes me. My roommates get along really well but I just feel left out like I don’t even exist. People use me as well. They use all the things I have, most times without asking. I’m super nice and I like helping others but when I need help, no one comes through. I feel super depressed and I drink a bunch of alcohol and I started doing drugs to cheer me up about my crappy life. I really want to commit suicide and I attempted it like 2 years ago, maybe nows the time :( I just feel so down and out and people say “It’ll get better”  or “you’ll get through this” but I feel thats bs. I just don’t have the will to continue and my grades have suffered significantly. My gpa is below 2.0 and that makes me even more depressed/sad. Im not motivated and I miss most of my classes. People also make fun of me. Like when literally anyone talks to me, I just cheer up and it makes my day. Like I got hugged from a friend and I got teary. When I see people happy, I get kinda sad because I know I’m missing out. I’m also fairly insecure. I have family issue but its not super bad but still an issue that stresses me out. Im also atheist but I’m scared to tell my parents because of their feelings and how they’re going to take it. I told them I’m depressed and they say its a fad that kids do these days. I cant open up and express my feelings without being judged. High-school also sucked so much and I know college is different and all but that impacts me as a person so much. On the outside, I look like I’m fine/happy but on the inside I’m just crying. Everyone struggles and fights their own battles but I just need help from someone, just someone to console me. Like when one of my suite-mates says “goodnight” to me, I get so fucking happy.  I’m not sure wether I should leave my contact info or not. I don’t know what the reaction to this will be. My biggest fear is that someone will figure out who wrote this and that scares me. One of my suite-mates really degrades me personally, and I feel like doing something to him. I hate being myself.  My main struggle is just being so damn lonely and not being extroverted. Ive just given up of life at this point. I over think about my flaws and all. (don't want to be specific it’ll become obvs) I feel like a fucking mess who is just fucked up. I just want to cry and let my feelings out but I have no one to talk to and I feel as a guy there is a stigma associated with expressing feelings. I'm writing this at 5am crying. \n",

He says that what we do is super casual and that he doesn’t want anything serious for a long while, but sometimes I think maybe he likes me too. I know I shouldn’t catch feelings for a fwb, but I can’t help myself. He knows more about me than anyone else; he’s seen me at my worst and helped me get to my best.

And this friend will pretend to be upset at the significant other for her own benefit; so that he will buy her food or something as forgiveness.

I have a lot of trouble forming real emotional bonds with other people beyond providing them with entertainment.

I no longer get sad about the relationship, and I'm over it. But over these 3 years, there hasn't been a single day I haven't thought about him, simple things like \"what is he doing?\" \"Is he having fun?\" \"I hope he's happy\". There was a time I thought I was over him, I did not love him anymore and I didn't even want to talk to him; I wasn't needy of him. You know how when you end a relationship people tend to remind you \"there's more fish in the sea\" and \"he's not the only good guy out there\" etc etc? I have actually dated a good number of guys and I can say yes, I know I'm attractive to other guys and yes, there's good guys out there. The problem is, I always end up comparing them to my ex, and as good as the guy might be he's not the guy I want. I've tried giving others a chance and no one really fulfills my needs in a partner like my ex did. How did I realize I still loved him? Possibly the hottest, sweetest guy showed the biggest level of interest in me, the guy I'd always describe when asked \"what would your perfect guy be?\" When I hung out with him I felt great, butterflies and all that stuff, but nothing close to what I felt for my ex. You can tell me my celebrity crush is head over heels with me and i'll still choose my ex over him. Now that I've come to terms with this and that it's not going away anytime soon, I just can't go out with guys, I get bored, I don't want to and I even feel guilty even though I'm single. My ex has told me he still has feelings for me, but we've had no further conversation. I don't wanna annoy him or bother him, I just want him to be happy even if that's not with me. \n",

I can hear him now: “Ey now this is for my bubba’s burfday and if I don’t got this cake by tonight I’m gonna be the biggest chump in town ya hear?” And by god, at this pace? The man is gonna get his cake. When he fingers me, I see Jesus. When I squirt, I feel like I AM Jesus and this is the second (or fourth, fifth, who’s been counting?) cumming and I’m not even Christian. I’m boutta put SoCal permanently out of a drought once spring break ends. Fr tho, I didn’t realize how much I love it til now...lowkey think I might be adickted to how it feels. It’s just so amazing and when he builds up to it I also get little mini orgasms. He has such beautiful fingers.\n",

      "4400 I've just started a relationship, but I feel different a weird this time. I really like this girl, and i'm willing to put in more commitment (and I have been). But at the same time, I think i've frustrated her because of my complete lack of possessiveness. This is new for me. I used to be far more attached to love interests. This time though, I seem to have this grounded expectation that it most likely will not work out. I am acutely aware that I am probably not the best match, that there will always be competition, and that there are just so many factors which will most likely lead to failure in moving forward. My experience has been that if there is one thing, just one thing wrong, boom they're gone and they ghost. I still am blindly moving forward, but I really don't care about the 'factors' which most people freak out about. She told me that she was going to a bar with her friends and she said she wasn't going to talk to anyone there. I told her it was completely fine to talk to anyone and I trust her. I trust her because I am not attached to the outcome. I'm happy if things continue moving forward. But I really don't care if something else happens, even if a 'seed' of doubt is implanted in her mind. Boom, she's gone forever just like everyone else and i'm back in the same familiar situation, if you feel? It's just weird and different to think that. It's also weird that I kind of don't care if a partner cheats. At that point, the relationship was over anyways. Does it really make a difference if they had a new partner lined up or not? It seems like my previous fears were just an attempt to deflect blame onto something concrete.\n",

The only problem is that she cooks so late, like right now, she is literally chopping food at the kitchen right now and scraping her chopping knife on the cutting broad,  which is rly annoying.... How should I kindly tell her that this is disturbing without sounding mean ? She comes home everyday around 7 or 8 PM or earlier. When she got home she will leave her tupperwares in one the sink compartments. Then take out the stuff she is about to cook, sometimes leaving it at the countertop for two hours. She will then go back to her room or stay at the living room watch Netflix or on phone with her friends/ family or so for an hour before going back to cooking. I tried to tell her that I’m going to sleep by turning off my lights, she gets it but oh god she still bangs her chopsticks, spatualas whatever so loud 😭😭😭. Even in cases when I’m not feeling well and needed rest, I clearly told her that and ofc nothing changed 😕😕😕.

      "4411 A lot on my mind so I'm just going to dump out everything I'm thinking as of this break. It's been a few years since my ex and I had parted ways, and pretty much all of the feelings have gone away now. Time really does heal, and so does getting away from their social media to not be reminded of them. Even though I don't have them on anything anymore I still feel that I care about them, but having them keep contact is too much of a burden for what it's currently worth. Sometimes I wonder how they're doing and if life has been good to them, and sometimes when I'm down I wish they had it worse than me. Regardless of what goes on I still think in my heart that they were a wonderful person during our relationship and that I wish they find happiness in what they do wherever they go. Despite our mistakes we made in high school and college I still treasure them as much as I did when we spent time together, even though I haven't talked to her in years. Recently I have been meeting new people in my clubs and other orgs too, and I think they're nice people, but it doesn't feel as warm as my first one did. I don't think I'm cut out for relationships; I feel enough fulfillment making friends that I couldn't make before. Anytime someone asks me about dating I just tell them I'm interested in someone as a placeholder.\n",

      "As for my own life, as the end of my college career nears I feel more and more pressure from my family to find an internship and eventually a job. I feel as though I was never mentally prepared during admissions season in high school and if I could go back in time to replace my freshman self with me, I would save a lot of headache and disappointment to my parents. From sophomore to junior year in high school a lot of people need to make a decision that would impact how the rest of their life would play out. I wasn't ready to make such a decision then and I feel like now I'm regretting my path I've walked. A part of me tells me to get into a stable job with good security, and another part says follow a \"dream\" that could shatter as soon as my drive and ambitions do. I'm much too afraid to tell my parents that I regret my decisions, yet I still want to do my best in classes and fear failure and rejection. I'm at that point in life where many of my friends, just like many others, are going through different phases in life; getting married, getting internships/jobs, travelling the world, etc. While the only thing I've done is go to class, clubs, and a few places to travel with family. I have this unconscious benchmark of my friends' lives compared to mine and if I'm falling behind, I get scared. There are times where I wish I had the mental capacity and discipline that my friends do to go out and succeed, and live fulfilling lives. And then sometimes I wish that my parents didn't push me to go into a path that compensates satisfaction and mental well-being for stability and a good salary just to brag to family and friends during get-togethers. \n",

My one and only relationship that lasted through high school to college, although ending somewhat sourly, was something I wouldn't trade for the world. I still want to prove to my parents that I can be on my own and that coming to America wasn't in vain. I want to be a person that is successful enough to tell my kids that they can choose a path in life that they want without worry for financial problems because of my old past and parents' upbringing.

I have experience working in startups, but the work I did for the startups does not meet the \"increased x by doing y\" criteria for resume entries.

I am also terrible at the coding interview preparation websites like hacker-rank and leetcode (I can't do the intermediate to hard level problems which they will actually test you on).

Anyways, obviously with so many people it was hard to make conversation. In addition, she was in a really weird mood, and after being asked, she told me that something happened and she can’t get her mind off it, and was basically texting the entire time. I tried asking what was wrong, but she didn’t want to talk about it. So I tried to make small conversations which failed because they would just end after a few sentences. In the end I suggested we leave and go our separate ways. The reason was because I felt she didn’t want to be there and she has anxiety problems and since we just met, I didn’t feel comfortable pestering her about what was wrong in fear of making her feel uncomfortable.\n",

I basically didn't start early on my PAs, didn't study well for my exams, and didn't get proper rest/nutrition. I came in Winter quarter thinking I would do better, but it was more of the same.

I love my degree and I'm very passionate about it. I understand/pickup the material pretty quickly (when I'm not forced to skip half the lectures because of CSE 30 and still score terribly on the PAs because of stupid mistakes). It's just that I'm terrible at studying for exams and procrastination is ruining my grades. I know I can do better.

It's having no motivation to do even the smallest things, like getting up to shower or brushing my teeth. Like, these are basic things I know I /should/ do, but on my bad days, I can't even bring myself to do them. I can't even bother to change out of two-day-old clothes. I can't even motivate myself to eat for fuck's sake, and because of that, I feel even more disgusting and gross. And the thing that sucks is, other people probably just think I'm lazy. It gets worse when it comes to school. I /know/ I have to get out of bed to go to lecture and lab, but some days, I just don't, and I feel guilty every time I have to email a professor or TA about my absence or turning in late work because my brain is like \"you don't deserve to do this! you were just lazy!\" when logically I know it's because of my mental illness. You know what else sucks? No matter how much sleep I get, I'll still feel tired, whether its the meds or the illness--I'll never know lmfao. And the days just go by, and on really bad weeks, I feel so detached, it's like I'm just watching myself go through the motions of life. I'm not even living. Depression and anxiety aren't quirky, and I've been dealing with them since high school. They stole my youth, so stop acting like they're some sort of personality trait. Also, institutions of higher education (or, well, educational institutions in general) need to improve how they support their mentally ill students.\n",

One of the TAs I had this quarter, probably the first one I’ve had in my time here who I have found to attractive on any level (and I found her really fuckin’ attractive) wears a pair. I don’t know why, but glasses increases attractiveness by like a hundred times for me. It makes someone who’s already really fuckin’ good looking even cuter/hotter/whatever. Not sayin’ I discriminate against ladies with 20/20 or near 20/20 vision, but specs add on a ton. I don’t even know why I have this...quirk. Maybe it’s the part of me that’s turned on by intelligence and I associate glasses with intelligence even though all glasses are an indicator of is a physical disability. I don’t know how many of you folks have this quirk too or if it applies to the girls as well when they look at dudes.\n",

No one in the apartment is done with finals yet you bring your friends over. The same fucking two people where all you guys do is sit downstairs and somehow scream at everything. Why do you need to play your videos in full volume all the fucking time? I can hear everything from upstairs. I’ve told you multiple times from previous finals to lower your voices and you just say “oh sorry” and the next time it’s the same thing. I’m tired of keeping telling you how to not be distruptive.

Now to say I'm not involved in college would be a flat out lie as I'm in so many different orgs, extracurricular activities/ interest groups that everyone is always astonished by how much I do. Lol I even volunteer both on campus and in the SD community! Online dating has also been a nightmare and pretty unfruitful as well for people wanting actual relationships. I just feel that's it's pathetic that someone who has so many interests and would be such a solid partner is going to be forever single. What's wrong with me? Am I just unattractive? I don't think so because I've been asked out before-they were just with incompatible people.  Are my standards just too high? Lol I think some of my preferences are definitely not greek by any standard. But you know, maybe it's just emotional maturity which not only sounds pretentious af, but seems a definite possibility. I dunno I'm just a relationship-hungry triton who wants actual relationship experience before they leave college.\n",

There's this guy who I've been talking with for almost a year and he recently brought up that he still has feelings for me and I think I want to give him a chance but his reputation and his history is making me think that it's going to be a mistake. I thought it was fine that we just stay being friends but recently when i hang out with him I want us to do more relationshipy type stuff and I've never had a bf too. So the problem is that he's basically a fuckboy, I thought that the reason why he started talking to me is to take my virginity and I still am but he's been talking about just wanting to be in a relationship since he's tired of just having fuck buddies- ie. Fuckboy. My friends say that he just say things like this to manipulate me and Yes his reputation is that bad. But he has never treated me wrong during this whole time I've known him. He has showed me so much kindness yet my mind blocks me from having feelings for him since I don't want to be \"one\" of his girls. He complains about going on dates with other people but can never find someone who's ever interesting as me yet I don't feel the sparks sometimes with him. I feel like another reason is the whole \"you want what you cant have\" i think about how once I do give him a chance that he's not going to be interested after. The real question in my mind is that should I forget his history and reputation since he can't change his past- and give him a chance ? \n",

      "4498 I really hate myself for being an ace. I honestly wish I could just go up to someone and think that I thought their body was attractive and want to have sex with them like others do. Because nobody (Except maybe certain religious groups) wants to go on dates or chill without the promise of sex. And good luck finding a robust and fun-loving community like LGBT people have-it just can't properly exist for asexuals by design. It just makes any kind of romantic or even personal intimacy very hard or impossible to come by which is strangely depressing to me. Am I just a bad ace in practice for wanting these things? \n",

      "4504 My parents are onto me again about me being gay and honestly it’s funny how the fears you nurture as a child never lose their potency when you grow into maturity. I haven’t felt this kind of fear in years, but the fact that I am now makes me feel like I’m reduced to the helpless kid I used to be (and I guess, still am). Honestly I’ve been doing so well—I got through a break up, I’ve been doing better than I hoped in all my classes, and I’ve met such great people since having stepped foot in college. It’s just funny how all that can change if my parents knew (and therefore condemned me) of my homosexuality. This isn’t something I like to say to my friends, because I’d hate to make them worry, but suicide has been (now more than ever) a possibility I’ve considered throughout much of my adolescence, and even has been something I have made attempts at. This feeling of dread I have now because of my fear of getting caught is so paralyzing, and sometimes I feel like the only way to reassume mastery over my life is to end it. Since years have passed I’ve embraced the notion that suicide is never an answer, but sometimes it’s more than just an ‘answer’, I sometimes it’s just wanting to be able to breathe again. I don’t know where this ramble is taking me, but I do know that this perpetual struggle of keeping my identity secret from my family is exhausting. I’ve had the stamina to last this long under the guise of the son/brother they expected me to be, but it has taken everything from me.

His love has always been unconditional, because anything that happens will not change how he feels about me, and he has always made that very clear. He said that the Greeks had four words for love, each with a different connotation. And each flavor of love for each individual is different. The color of my love for him is light blue, as opposed to magenta for my boyfriend. This all might sound strange, but I just want to tell everyone! I'm so happy. He is the family that I never had, I cant stop thinking about the giant smile he had on when I told him, and I too was grinning like an idiot. Is love supposed to feel this great? Please advise me on how to deal with these overwhelming emotions in a healthy way, because all o can do right now is cry and smile and I can't sleep and I feel like I'm about to explode.

It was all planned. My then boyfriend travelled from Arizona and booked a hotel room for a few days. We had an amazing time as we finally got to spend entire days together after three years of purely online interactions. But I was 17 and he was 19, so I couldn't tell anyone because I didn't want him to get into legal trouble. We're still together, but we've been engaged for over a year now and we get to see each other way more often. We don't have sex very often but it's not nearly as awkward as it was that first time. I am very grateful for him, and although he might not have his life together (and I might be a morosexual), he's the world to me. I wouldn't change this for anything.\n",
      "4588 I absolutely love and appreciate having a clitoris. Imagine if the clitoris was  in the vagina? Masturbating wouldn’t be as easy. I could just rub my clit over my panties for a good five minutes and my hands will be nice and dry still. Also, if the clitoris is treated right, you could get the most AMAZING orgasms. I love playing with myself so I know what I like, so I could have a guy do the same on me (specifically with oral sex). It’s a shame most guys suck at giving head. Out of the 17 guys that have gone down on me, only 4 were actually good and understood my directions. Those same 4 guys got me to finish with a mind blowing orgasm in less than 5 minutes. I also love having a vibrator, which gives me a similar sensation to what a guy’s tongue can do for me. I wish I had a consistent person to go down on me, though. But most guys want actual sex and I don’t have sex with guys unless I’m seriously them, and finding a boyfriend is wayyyy harder than finding a fwb, so I guess I’ll continue to pleasure myself with my right hand.\n",

I also noticed they have Dj’s and a dance floor, unlike other frat parties where no one dances and everyone just stands there. Had a great time, and even though i'm not Latina, they were really nice and cheered me on when I was on the dance floor lol.  \n",

On Valentine’s Day, he didn’t get me a gift or anything while I took hours making his gift, after he lied to me saying he went to the store when he never did... only to make me bring his whole present while he tells me he needs a break. I understand why he’d need a break because he doesn’t have much money or a car and we live far away so he said he didn’t want to put me through his bullshit. Also he lied to me about not being able to see me because he couldn’t afford it. I understand but it’s no reason to lie, especially right after I got all ready and cleared my schedule.  He eventually asked me to give him another chance and I kind of regret it. At the beginning of the relationship I’d feel so loved and he’d send me such sweet texts in the morning and then suddenly he just started acting lazy and doesn’t care. I asked why and he just said he’s comfortable now and he knows I won’t leave him... but I don’t think this is right. I feel like you should always put 100% into a relationship if u really love them and idk if he does. I shouldn’t be questioning his feelings all the time. And then he tells me that he doesn’t want to even text anymore because he doesn’t like texting and didn’t really give me a good reason when we used to text all day... I don’t see any effort on his part and idk what todo at this point because I couldn’t imagine how much pain I’d feel leaving him but deep down I know I deserve better... or is this normal for guys and should I just expect the low effort on his part? Sometimes I feel like I’ll never find another guy if I leave him...\n",

      "3 years ago, my ex broke up with me (i didn't want to). About a month after, one of his friends who I used to like before dating my ex started casually flirting with me, and kinda trying to get my ex completely out of my head i flirted back, although this lasted like a week at most. I knew the guy and my ex got along well, but had no idea to what extent their friendship went, and from what I still know he's just the kind of \"friend\" who's more than an acquaintance but less than a best friend or actual friend. To put this into perspective, they never engage in a conversation unless they're in the same place, where they friendly greet each other and start talking non stop (this is as much as I know about them). Anyways, he left for college and 4 months later came back and asked me out. At this point, my ex and I weren't talking, I asked for no contact when we broke up and I really wasn't interested in having a friendship with him, only being in \"friendly terms\" but we agreed I would message him whenever I wanted this to happen. So I went out with this guy, and ended up sleeping with him. He was my first and not my ex, because I didn't feel ready with my body while I was with my ex but I felt comfortable one year later and wanted to try. We started a fwb type of thing, although I later found out myself he was kind of my rebound to try and stop loving my ex. Stuff happened between this guy and I, and we stopped talking. Somewhere between this, I messaged my ex back because I felt I had \"already forgotten about him\" and was ready to just be on friendly terms. This was roughly 6 months after the breakup. Fast forward 6 more months, and after not seeing him for a year we met up (he wanted to know how I was doing) and I realized i still cared for him. Fast forward 4 more months and I travelled to the US from my home country, he came to visit me for a weekend, so did i, and we hooked up. This is when I knew I still had lingering feelings for him. Fast forward 6 months and he invites me to stay over at his apt. We hook up again, we cuddle and this is when I realized I actually still love him. We're still hooking up, and we've both confessed we still have feelings for each other. It took me this long to realize I want him back, and he's the reason I am never satisfied with any guys I try to date. However, the more I realized he DID matter to me, the worse I felt about sleeping with someone he knew. I want him back, i love him and only him but I can't bear to make a move feeling this guilty, and I don't know why if 1) we were broken up, 2) i didn't know and still don't know if their friendship goes beyond a friendly exchange of words at certain meetings once a year plus didn't care since I wasn't talking to my ex and 3)  i didn't even want to get back with him at that point, in fact I wanted him out of my life as much as I possibly could, so I couldn't love him ever again. Should I still tell him? I'm desperate to make a move but feel nervous and don't want to lose him. A bunch of people have told me I shouldn't since we were exes at the time and they aren't close but I still don't know. \n",

      "4709 I fucked up. I fucked up so bad. It’s been a year and a half with my boyfriend, the most amazing man I’ve ever been with in my life. He treated like royalty. He did anything for me literally anything and loved me unconditionally. Before I began college (I’m a freshman) and before I even dated him, i always dreamt of living the single college life going to parties and having fun talking to boys and all that. When I got here my first week I cheated. I know. Don’t give me the well it’s your fault I know it is. Back then my mentality was i Want to experience some college fun. It lasted more than just one time, me and this boy started to have a little fling every now and then meanwhile I was telling my boyfriend i loved him. I hate myself so much for it. Just two days ago he found out and it broke both of our hearts. I tried my hardest to fight for our relationship and to my surprise, he took me back. I couldn’t believe it. I’m enternally grateful for it but I know his heart is shattered. It breaks my heart that I broke his. This makes me never want to go ‘ experience college ‘ I just want to be with him forever. I want him to treatment like he did but he can’t even kiss me he says because he imagines me doing it to the guy. I just wanna move past it and be all in love again. The thing is I don’t know if we’ll ever been the same and that scares me to death. If things aren’t the same why be together. Idk. Just venting, don’t expect comments. I can’t even tell my friends because it’ll make me look bad. He turned off his location, doesn’t tell me where he goes anymore he tries his hardest to ignore me but eventually gives in. I don’t blame him I don’t even deserve it.Today he came over to my house and that was nice. Just happened 2 days ago too. I lied about what I told him too. I told him we didn’t have sex but we did, probably 4-5 times. He has a gut feeling I did too but I can’t tell him that or he will really leave. I also can’t tell him that the first time we had sex the guy came inside of me, something I didn’t expect him to do at all and I was scared to death and we went to buy plan b together. I can’t ever tell my bf this he would really hate me. I just told him we kissed 3 times. Even with that he’s broken I can’t imagine him knowing everything and I still feel so shitty and guilty. And like I said, don’t make me feel worse, don’t tell me that. I should tell him because I’m not. I just really hope and pray we can go back to normal. We were the IT couple, he did everything for me, candle lit dinners, rose petal beds, huge prom poster asking infront of the whole school, love letters, everything. I can’t belive I almost threw that all away. I love him so fucking much and I just wanna make him happy again. \n",

It felt so weird not having control, like I just had this impulse of wanting to suck his dick and I used to think dicks were weird and ugly as fuck like 2 months ago.

Like I usually value a guy's being more than I do his physique, so I felt like I was sexualizing him because of this.  I've had relationships with other guys before, but we never had sex and I never really wanted to. I don't know what it is about this guy though that I actually want him to take my virginity like is it my hormones acting up?  I also didn't  know how to get the feeling over with when it happened.

I also spent a lot of time at the country. I just never felt at home in a city like San Diego. I love UCSD, I love my friends from here and I know that my hometown will always be there for me.

      "4840 Do you ever form a crush on someone after one call? For work, I had to call imprints and this one guy picked up and we talked for a really long time and I got the feeling that he was being flirty. I didn't think much of it except that he was really nice but now he keeps sending me a lot of emails and tbh they make me laugh. Reading his emails makes me so happy and kickstarts my day. He's not a student at UCSD anymore, and he's probably way older than me, but I just want to meet him in person and have him take me out on a date. It's so rare to find someone who has the same type of humor as me. Should I stop responding to him and look for other guys my age or should I follow this You've Got Mail storyline to the end?\n",
      "4841 there's this one guy in my org who i grew to fall in love with over time. it started with simple jokes but he just gets me and during our meetings we make eye contact all the time and smile. the one problem is that he's going to be transferring to another school after this year and i'm afraid of starting anything with him because i'm afraid my heart will get broken. should i take the risk or be content with the eye contact?\n",

      "He's gay. I'm also, like, 97% gay and I can't say I didn't know, but yeah! I'm not mad at having another gay friend/acquaintance, so this was a nice conclusion to a crush. \n",

      "4844 I always considered myself straight but I met a new guy friend back in my hometown over winter break and I noticed I had feelings for him. Things started off slow but turns out he had feelings for me too. We are both lowkey and I just find it crazy because I liked him a lot. We hung out basically all of break together and even spent New Years and Christmas together (only at night though). We ended things because he wants to be just friends cause he isn't ready for a relationship..... annoying as hell because I felt the same but at least I had the balls to admit I was willing to give a DL relationship a try with him. I still miss him sometimes haha. I have hope since he is trying to transfer here, hopefully he gets in...  \n",
      "4845 Did anyone from ChemE or NanoE get any internships this year? I’ve been applying to so many companies and I feel that my time is running out. I know we live in a heavily marketed biotech area, but I feel that I’m competing in a saturated market. I’m not even talking about just biotech. It’s just rejection after rejection. I'm scared because I keep hearing internships are important to my resume, and I'm going to be lacking that another summer. Ahhhhhhhhh!\n",
      "4846 I’m a first year and am going to start working out again now that my most stressful quarter is done. I worked out at main gym 3-4 times a week back in Fall quarter but I barely recieved results and I think its partially due to my diet on campus. I feel like its so hard to find healthy options at dining halls; I don’t trust the fruit on display because my friends have found larvae and mold on them. Is there anything I could eat besides salads that could help me get that summer body lol? I would cook for myself and meal prep but its difficult in the dorms. Also what should I do to improve my regime? The basic structure is 15 minutes of cardio, 40 minutes of weights, 15 minutes of core, and 10 minutes to stretch. Pls help me\n",
      "4847 I've been told that I should write down my thoughts and what goes on in my mind instead of going to therapy. I am only writing this to see other people's thoughts of what is going on in my head. Please don't write things like \"hmu OP.\" I'm not here to try to make myself feel better or something. I don't know. If I seem like a kid that doesn't appreciate what he has, I am sorry. I try to be as grateful as I can, especially to my family. They try to give me a better future in their own way. This was just what I wrote in an hour when left to myself for an hour.\n",

      "Some backstory. I'm just your average kiddo trying his best. My dad left to America when I was six to work and  I lived with my mom my entire until I came to live with my Dad for high school. I have always been told to do my work now and good things will eventually come. I'm still waiting for them to come. I have been suicidal for too many years that I can't count anymore. Or maybe not. Is it normal to think about killing yourself? I've only ever seriously tried to commit suicide three times and that was when I was much younger. The other times I pussyed out. I don't think I'll commit suicide anymore either. I've spent most my life saying, I've already toughed this much out, might as well wait for good times. Anyways, the rest of this is kind of long and just my thoughts. I tried to paragraph them the best I could, I hopped between topics that were on my mind so if it is hard to read, I'm sorry.\n",
      "\n",
      "Your life is a joke. Your family are basically robots and they don't care about shit other than success. Asian culture is possibly the worst possible methodology of raising a child. Raising a kid and allowing him to pursue his passion is what is always preached but never used. I've actually had my parents straight up say they don't care what my passion is. It's like I'm not living my own life. I'm just walking down a pre-laid path, stumbling around until I die. I wonder what the suicide rates among asians are compared to the rest of the population. Is it really a tragedy when a student commits suicide? Is it really uncommon? There was already a student that committed suicide this fall quarter, but nobody addresses it. They just brush it under the rug and pretend like it has never happened. I didn’t even know until now. What kind of system does that? Is it a fault in our system that causes that? If i were to commit suicide, I feel as if I was determined, It would already be too late. I’m a stubborn guy haha. If i was like “This is it and i will commit suicide” I would always be curious what kind of people are truly kind and true to themselves. As much as I criticize on my family for only being there for face value and never really showing others how they really feel, I honestly do the same. I feel as though I might be a sociopath or psychopath in that sense. I wonder if all my family is like that.\n",
      "\n",
      "They never really show their emotions and they just do whatever it takes to better their own state. They don’t take into account other people and they will easily throw someone to the curb in order to better themselves. I feel as though they only do charity or seem kind so that they can front or tell themselves that they are genuinely good people. I do that too. I’m not a saint. I’m a major hypocrite. All my life I’ve been wondering if I am a good person. Do good people really doubt whether they’re even nice? They just do it unconditionally. If I have to think “I’m going to be a good person”, I can’t be a genuinely good person. I'm proud to say unlike my family that I feel sympathy though. I hold so much sympathy and patience for so many people. Except my family. I don't know why, but my patience runs thin with them and I get frustrated so easily by them now. Maybe its because my family is the only people who I get to see behind the curtains. I see them when they pretend to be nice. Laugh at other peoples jokes and then turn around and scoff at how they’re stupid. They’re lack of sympathy and empathy, projecting their anger on anyone even if they have nothing to do with anything.\n",
      "\n",
      "I remember specifically this one time, my family was traveling and we took a taxi to a hotel that took a longer route just to make money. I understand it is scummy and hey they shouldn't have done that and taken advantage of us.I would be mad too. But since the taxi already left there wasn’t much we could do. Then my father went into the hotel and berated the woman who was working the front desk for what the taxi service has done. Why? That person had nothing to do with what they did. Why would you get worked up and mad at her specifically? They can’t do anything about it. I tried to calm him down and tell him to relax. What would yelling at them do. They aren't even responsible for what happened. And then he pushed me to the side and yelled at me. He said “THIS DOES NOT INVOLVE YOU.” After he was done yelling at the clerk, he came over to me and said “See? This is why you can’t let them take advantage of you. Never just get stepped on and always stand up for yourself.” Did you really think that was a valuable lesson? A teaching moment? All it let me know is that I can't believe in my family. They can't be my role models. They honestly aren’t anything like me. The dad that I have memories of, the one that I remember that had so much happiness and saw the world with so much love and care and sympathy, was very different then the real one I have. I guess it’s just the memory of a kid that's 6 years old that romanticize everything and sees people as perfect. But i don’t know. When I was younger I still knew my dad had anger issues. But it was Ok. Because he was still a  good person at heart right? \n",
      "\n",
      "My mom is a different story. I’m not sure what fond memory I have with her. All I remember is being forced to do things I didn't want. All I remember is getting beaten all the time. The memory that comes to me most is when I was in the corner and she punched me in the face and I fell on the ground. The memory is so muddled now and I can’t remember why she did it anymore. All I remember was the shock, pain, and sadness. Most of what is messed up with me I feel like is sourced from my mom. I actually think I might have been traumatized haha. My mom and my brother used my fear of the dark against me to make me do what they wanted. All I wanted to do was play with my friends and I understand that work needs to be done but I only got to work when I was younger. All those times locked in the garage and the basement. I still remember the fear and the hours I spent crying. I remember one time when I wanted to run away from home, and actually got the courage to do it. I left. And ran. Crying the entire time. Of course I couldn't even outrun my sister. She convinced me to come back. Her kindness is the only thing in my family. And when I came back the look on my moms face. Devoid of any sympathy. Just straight anger. Hilarious.\n",

      "I'm not sure. Maybe I'm just lonely. I've tried to fill my life with things that might make me feel better. I've taken drugs before. I've surrounded myself with friends.

I had to deal with sudden moving at the end of the quarter and working extra shifts last week so I had no time the past almost 2 weeks to study and work on projects. I have a final project due this week and my finals are early in finals week. I decided to do school work while I can and skip most of my TDGE class (it's a 3 hour lecture). I understand the professors frustration with students being careless towards his class, but he humiliated everyone at the end of class who came late and pinpointed us as students who cheat their way through school and don't give a shit. That is not fair because I am working harder than most people I know and am still struggling academically and mentally (battling depression and anxiety). I was crying for 20 minutes after on the second floor of center hall because that was just so hurtful. I am not saying it is okay to go late to class, and I do feel bad that I disrespected him in that way. But I wish he was more careful with how he addressed this, and I wish he didn't assume that we are all irresponsible students in front of the lecture of 200 students.

Being hungry for what I felt like I’d been “missing out on”, I took him up on his offer and we became fwb. I knew it wouldn’t last- I’d heard all the stories and seen all the examples.

I fell deeper and deeper as time went on to the point where I found it damn near impossible to let him go.

We hadn't brought any of this other stuff up before and I was just so shook,, this man was so straightforward with me (which I appreciate bc we love each other but nonetheless shook). Here I am planning to cuddle up with him, considering that I've literally only kissed him on the cheek, and he's waiting to see my thoughts on x-y-z. While yeah I would maybe want to try certain things and am willing to keep an open mind, I really want to keep it above the waist for the sake of the relationship,, bUt he's a spicy kind of guy. And so while he says he's fine with not doing certain things, I can't help but wonder if the passion will decrease on his end because there's other things that he's experienced and enjoys. I want to please my man ofc and I know he's understanding, but I want to stay strong with what I believe.

I would barely talk to people and I was the quiet girl who sat with a group of people who didn’t care enough to invite me to things. The very few decent friends I did have were sort of the outcasts in high school, which meant that I probably was too. I was sort of involved, but I wasn’t very good at what I did. Around senior year I felt like I was finally becoming more outgoing which helped. Anyway fast forward to college and I decided to do sorority recruitment. Now that I was in college, I felt like I could be my 100% self. I ended up in a well-respected sorority. Most of my sisters were clearly popular in high school, and the guys we hang out with in other frats looked like they were popular too. I feel like I still am still sort of obviously awkward and I feel like they would judge me if they knew what I was like in high school. And I feel like people in high school are probably shocked and confused now that I’m in a good sorority, and would even think I am living a lie. I know this probably sounds so stupid, but it’s something that’s been bothering me. I think I rushed to validate myself which makes me ashamed. I do really like the sorority I am in because the girls are genuine and chill, but I think if I was the same person I was in high school when I rushed, they would’ve not invited me back. \n",

You are not above anyone because I wear a service uniform and you don’t. It’s time to get off your high horse and realize that your peers (and quite frankly EVERYONE) you meet are worthy of basic respect. You were probably raised to act this way, but now that you’re in your own you have to learn how to respect others. \n",

But when I ask for  help with something very personal and upsetting, they don't have 30 minutes to listen to me over the phone.

You like to make bold proclamations about how you WILL accomplish something, yet something, somehow, always gets in the way. You’re deceptive with money in the hopes that someone will overpay you or that someone won’t ask for money back. You cling to other people to the point of toxicity, calling them your “littles” when you know our org doesn’t have those. You’re a quasi alcoholic who not only drinks to his limit, but is proud of it, and makes sure everyone knows by posting it on your snap story. In fact you post pretty much every part of your life on your snap story. Most of all you creep on every girl you meet, emotionally attaching yourself to them in the hopes they will like you back romantically, which has never happened.

He forced my legs open and performed oral sex on me, then pushed me to perform oral sex on him, knowing damn well it was my first time giving and receiving. He took advantage of how naive and innocent I was and manipulated me and emotionally abused me. Why didn’t I report it to the police? Well, he was 17 and I was 18. There is no actual proof that interaction happened. I also once kept kissing him and when I confronted him later about him assaulting me, he said he could use the fact that I kept kissing his face and lips without his consent. Another thing is that after he cheated on me, I made a mess in his room, which he took pictures of after (I know this was extremely stupid and immature, but I’m my defense he was my first love, I didn’t know any better). I haven’t seen him for over 2 years now, but I still wish I could scrub away the feeling of his hands rubbing all over my body, his disgusting tongue on my private parts, and dry lips on my lips. I wish I could take a pill that would allow me to forget it.... I don’t wish to forget the mental and emotional abuse because it helped make me who I am today. But remembering my body being disrespected like that in no way benefits me. He’s being a lowlife now in his hometown but I really wish he didn’t even exist. Also when I confronted him about it he had the audacity to blame it on me saying I showed up to his dorm not wearing panties (I was wearing a bodycon that day). It makes me sick.

      "5031 Hey all, it’s straight guy from #9857. There has been a recent development that involves my confession and I felt like sharing it. After I typed out my confession, I gained the confidence to talk with my girlfriend about my fantasies involving her friends. I felt guilty sharing it with strangers and not the person I trust the most, so I sat her down and explained it all to her, and of course she wasn’t happy about it. I expected that and I encouraged her to share any feelings she had about other people but she insisted it was exclusive to me cause “I’m a disgusting pig.” Well, I was at least happy that I was honest with her. She was noticeably distant for a day, but she came to my apartment the next night. My roommate was out doing some club shit, we don’t really communicate a lot. So I answered the door and immediately notice that she was acting randy as hell. Ah ha, I am a booty call now. So I figured fuck it I’d fuck her then we’d talk about what I told her a couple days prior. We were deep into foreplay when there was a knock on my door. Damn, I thought, I was finna bust a nut and my roommate came back earlier than usual. Well, I was wrong, it was one of my girlfriend’s friends. One that I mentioned fantasizing about the most. Hmmmmm, I thought, hmmmm did my girlfriend invite her friend over so I have to embarrassingly tell her that I wanted to give her the ol American sausage? Again, my thought was wrong. My girlfriend came to the door and greeted her friend, then whispered in my ear “I brought you a present.” Decent half chub became a thing of the past. I was full Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson at that point. I’ll spare you most of the details but there is one thing that became very apparent that night. I couldn’t finish with her friend, I felt like I was going to bust a whole mayonnaise jar worth of nut for a solid 20 minutes but I couldn’t finish. I couldn’t until my gf decided to finish me off with a nice bj and man that was the best orgasm I ever had. \n",
      "After all was said and done, my gf explained to me that she is bi nut never thought to mention it to me because she was afraid I would just ask for a threesome. She said that she felt upset intitiallt when I talked to her, however the more and more she thought about me putting my dick in her friends, the hotter that idea became in her mind. And I told her that I realized that she is the only woman who will ever satisfy me, so we decided that it is one for her to bring girls over as long as we share them. \n",

As for my first two concerns, I could ask him to bring a copy of a current record of an STI test to the meeting in public and make sure to tell him that using a condom is a hard limit. I told him I didn't want to have sex and that was a hard limit (even tho I'm pretty sure it's not) and I'm concerned about how he'll treat my true hard limits if I tell him I changed my mind about having sex.\n",

      "5089 You wanna know the worst part about herpes?  It’s the stigma.  I got herpes as a teenager and I’ve had it for 10 years now.  I never have breakouts and I take antivirals.  Since I’m symptom free and take antivirals my partner would have a bigger risk of knocking me up than getting herpes (with a condom it’s <2% F to M transmission rate per year), but guys always freak out about it and say some shit like “Well I’m not trying to catch any diseases, but how about you suck my dick?” without any reciprocation.  Most of these guys have never even been tested for it and don’t even realize that most people who have it are asymptomatic (so they likely already have type I or II) and if they already have type I (cold sores), then they likely have enough antibody resistance naturally to not catch type II.  The only reason I know is because I specifically asked my Dr. for the antibody test after my ex tested positive.  Most people get cold sores and no one makes a big deal out of it, but as you have type II, the world freaks TF out and treats you like a slut.  I’ve also seen pharm techs make posts on IG about how disgusted they feel if a person is picking up antivirals and tried to hit on them.  It makes me feel like we are to be defined by this and treated like disgusting unworthy people.  We need love too.  I feel so conflicted telling partners about it now (my nurse said that if she were me she wouldn’t tell anyone), but I think that illegal and I’m afraid of getting sued like Usher.  Also, I always feel so nervous being with a guy and not telling him.  Anyway, I always use condoms now, but I wish HS had sex Ed in health and not just abstinence so I wouldn’t be in this position now.  \n",

I’m usually pretty bored when a guy goes down on me because it just feels slobbery and pretty much does not arouse me at all.  So, when you say shit like “Let’s focus on you.” and I get all uncomfortable, it’s not because I have some deep dark past, but it’s because I know nothing is going to come out of it and I’m just going to feel more frustrated than anything.  Also, I feel bad that you’re trying so hard and then you start feeling bad that you didn’t make me come (as if it’s a you problem when it’s clearly a me problem). FYI- I’ve tried a vibrator and masturbating, but it feels good for a few minutes and then I get bored.  Also, fuck you to all the guys who get all mad if a girl doesn’t cum.  Saying shit like why am I even trying? only makes the situation about 💯 times worse.\n",

To this day I've had 15 dates with 12 different girls. Only one girl went past the first date, the rest didn't want any more. There's this girl I really really like who's part of an org I'm in but I'm so terrified of more rejection, I like her way too much. I don't know what it will do to me if she says no, or worse she says yes and then changes her mind after the first date. I hate that I'm so scared. I hate that I'm so anxious.

She also disregarded my mental health struggles. The list goes on. I just can’t stand such horrible people, like how are you okay with being the way that you are???

Those that try to talk to me only do so because they have a slight interest in me romantically. They get close to me, I get attached, they confess, I get scared and reject them hoping to stay as friends, then they leave. I get why they would leave. Its extremely awkward to stay as friends with someone who rejected you, but its made me even more hesitant to talk to guys. Will I ever be able to connect with a guy platonically without the prospects of romance ruining things? Is it too much to ask for to be close friends with an opposite gender?\n",

      "5100 Sometimes my roommate plays League all day, or lies in bed all day watching YouTube videos. I don't mind most of the time, but we've gotten to be pretty close over the past year and a half, and it seems like almost every time I try to talk to them they get annoyed, like they don't want to talk, unless we're out doing something. It's really annoying because it could be the smallest thing, like do you want some cheetos, or whatever, and when it's like this for 12 hours or more a day it gets tiresome. I think they might be depressed or something but they are the type of person that won't help themselves or accept help from others. Honestly sometimes it really brings me down and I feel bad for them and I'm not trying to be selfish, but it's tough when I'm in a good mood and they kill it so fast, by acting like I'm annoying them every time I utter a word to them, or ask them about their day, or whatever. I'm getting pretty fed up with it and we're graduating soon and we're planning on finding a place together after college, but now I'm just not so sure anymore. Any suggestions as to how I could handle this? I'm a pretty tame roommate and don't talk that much or make a lot of noise, and while I know I have my flaws I don't believe I'm a difficult person to live with as I do care about being respectful towards those I live with. At this point I just don't know what to do. Oh btw, not it's not a romantic partner or anything, we're just friends/roommates.\n",

A lot of times when I talk to people for more than a few minutes I tend to get really excited and passionate about something or the conversation. I realize that this shit is happening, but I don’t really know how to control it and it leads me to always having awkward interactions.

However when we started talking about possibilities and prices I started to become a little concerned. We were hoping to get a 2 bedroom apart with a loft with around 4-5 people. Hoping to not break the bank but also be able to have a single I wanted to get the loft. But when calculating the pricing for each individual I was told that I would have to pay upwards to $1200 just for the loft. I don't really find this fair as frankly I would be paying more for the loft then I would be for the master bedroom. I brought up the thought of maybe it being to high of a price but was told that it would be higher because I would be living in the loft by myself. I've seen loft pricings for around $700 and don't feel like paying almost double the amount just because i wanna live with friends. Can anyone help me with what I should do? I feel like if I bring up the $700 price ill get shot down immediately. The housing hunt is starting soon. please help me figure out what I should do. I love my friends but I feel like i'm being scammed. \n",

After they release him, she divorces him, takes half of his things that she literally didn't pay a dime for (like she did not work at all the whole time they were married, not a single job or side hustle), and then uses the \"i'm a woman\" card. and so while I'm in her custody, she forces me to go to catholic church where I was molested on sundays, and left me with a babysitter who also loved little boys and raped me every other day for lets say a good 2 months. and after my mom realizes she can't fucking support us on minimum wage, she throws us back to our dad while still collecting child support for the rest of the year we're not being housed by her. and where was my male privilege in all of this? where was my dad's male privilege in all of this? \n",

I really want to let her down gently and tell her that I'm interested, but I just need to heal. It's a dick move to get into a relationship when you've got unresolved issues. IDK, am I being unreasonable? \n",

      "5264 Story time! I have (or had) a friend who I’ve been friends with since literally the first grade. She was like my first friend ever. Senior year of high school she started dating my guy best friend, and of course it got awkward. At first I was pretty like bummed out cause I knew that it’d changed all of our friendships forever. But then I learned to be happy for them and support them no matter what. So my guy best friend and I would always do things together. Obviously that were to change once they got together. But I guess things got too awkward between my girl friend and I , and I didn’t want her to hate me so I would push my guy friend away. Like all the time. And the few times where I needed him there or he’d asked to hang out I felt as if my girl friend was just secretely starting to hate me. Apparently she does hate me now. She started ignoring me, stopped hitting me up, she doesn’t look or approach me when we make eye contact in person (walking to class). She goes to UCSD and so does our other girl friend (my roommate), but she only approached her when I’m not around.  and the times I’ve gone back home on the weekends she decides to visit my roommate. I knew things were getting rocky, which is why I cut off my guy best friend, even after he said that all of our friendships should still be okay. I lost 2 best friends. I’m sure this is normal but it hurts. I feel like I can’t talk about it to anyone. I think what hurts me the most is that I’ve gone through hell and back this year. I had two family members pass away in a span of a week, one which I had to keep visiting at the hospital for over a month before her passing, this year has been really tough, and I didn’t have any of them there for me. Shouldn’t she have been there for me ? Knowing that we had 12+ Years of friendship on the line. I wasn’t asked how I was doing, I wasn’t supported through the process of having family members ill, let alone when they passed. And I hate that I cut my guy best friend off too because he’s literally been there for me for 6+ years. I hate to say it but I feel like I’m starting to be angry at her for not being there, for cutting me off, I just hate all of this. I think the major thing is that during the time my family member was in the hospital, I had to be going home a lot, and there was times my family couldn’t pick me up.. and she would drive back home and wouldn’t even try to ask if I needed a ride. That broke me so many times because I just wanted to be back home with my family. I feel like if she would’ve been a part of my life, so much could’ve gone different, I wouldn’t be feeling this. But anyways did I do something wrong ? Could I have done anything to prevent our friendships falling apart? Am I wrong for being upset? I just need advice on wtf to do or feel. Thank you if you took the time to read this, I guess I really needed to get it off my chest somewhere. \n",

      "5357 I find it difficult to fit in with people my age. As cliche as this may sound, I personally believe I was born in the wrong era. I was born in Asia and raised almost solely by my grandparents until I was 4, although they continued to look after me until my early teenage years. They're truly wonderful people and I'm proud to say that they (alongside my single mother and my biological uncle who I call my dad) raised me right (as far as I'm concerned) but the downside is that I've absorbed a lot of their mannerisms and viewpoints. While I know which beliefs and points of views to discard as they are wholly inappropriate for today's day and age, enough of their influence on me remain to this day to where I believe I am a middle aged man (at least) in a 19 year old guy's body. Consequently, it's hard for me to make too many friends or find very many romantic interests. In no particular order, here's a list of my characteristics and experiences that lead me to that conclusion (for lack of a better way to introduce this list):\n",
      "\n",
      "- Throughout middle and high school, I've successfully befriended a number of my teachers and sometimes found their company more enjoyable than that of some of my peers.\n",
      "- Very down-to-earth \n",
      "- Big history and politics nut. Absolutely can't care for and can do without pop culture (at least modern pop culture).\n",
      "- I generally consider an intellectual, a highbrow person (to a fault)\n",
      "- Quite behind on the sayings and memes of today. Didn't know what a 'dumpster fire' was (besides a literal fire in a dumpster) until about two months or so ago.\n",
      "- While I watch people play a variety of video games on YouTube, I am not in any way shape or form a gamer myself.\n",
      "- I don't have Netflix or Hulu and I genuinely do not recognize them as being legitimate competitors (with regards to their output) to television.\n",
      "- For me, TV today is crap with too many commercials and too much gratuitous sex and violence. Same goes for movies today. I just find TV \n",
      "and movies from yesteryear far better and more entertaining in many ways.\n",
      "- In regards to TV, I'm a big fan of informative programs (in depth news programs, the news in general, etc. from yesteryear and today) and light entertainment, shit like game shows and comedy programs (panel shows, improv, satire, topical stuff; so shows like Mock the Week from the UK and Whose Line from both the UK and US if you want an idea)\n",
      "- I generally watch TV shows and movies from at least 30 years ago, if not more.\n",
      "- I generally don't do animation except for things that make me feel nostalgic (SpongeBob, most of the stuff from early 2010s Nickelodeon and Cartoon Network, The Simpsons, and a few other things). I have never watched anime (nor do I have any desire or interest to) and Disney films are meh to me. I feel like I've outgrown them. \n",
      "- I don't care for EDM or rap or most of the rubbish they put on radio nowadays, which puts me at odds with about 95% of this campus and people my age (in my opinion). I'm a big classic rock fan. Love the Beatles (Sgt. Pepper's onwards) although I don't have any other particular bands that I like. I like individual songs more than bands. My music collection is comprised of rock from the '60s to the '90s along with some disco, new wave, instrumental/easy listening, and other things.\n",
      "- My philosophy when it comes to what I watch and listen to boils down to two main ideas: a) I like what I like and b) I don't care what the hell people listen to/watch these days, if you're really as good as people claim you are, I'll hear about you again in 30 years time and I'll see/watch you then.\n",
      "- I was taught to respect hierarchy wherever it exists, which makes it hard for me to mix in with the (very active) leadership of the org I'm involved in and get to know them as people. I see them as my superiors rather than as my peers and fellow humans and consequently, I feel that it's improper to pursue anything else but a good working relationship with them. This is in spite of having attended multiple house parties with them where I witnessed them getting absolutely blitzed and consequently got to learn the most incredible and personal things about them.\n",
      "- My idea of a fun time with friends is around a table with drinks and/or good food and just chatting and laughing the night away in solid conversation. No need for loud music or shouting or a darkened room with flashing lights or drunkenness.\n",
      "- I am not a clubber. Never envision myself going out clubbing at any time ever. Can't stand club music (specifically it's loudness), generally don't like the club scene, or staying out into the wee hours of the morning.\n",
      "- Tries to finish all my work so I can sleep by midnight or 1 at the latest.\n",
      "- Still a defender of the notion that chivalry isn't dead, of treating everyone with kindness and respect irrespective of who/what they are in relation to you, of loyalty and commitment to family, friends, romantic partners, etc. \n",
      "- Still explicitly asks girls out on a \"date\", still a believer in giving flowers and chocolates just because, still a believer in true love \n",
      "- Similarly, I absolutely do not believe in Tinder. Don't have one, don't intend on making one. I'm looking for something real and enduring. I don't have the time or energy for casual flings or one time hookups.\n",
      "- Similarly, I don't have the time or energy for fake people and fake friends. Consequently, my circle of friends is relatively small.\n",
      "- I genuinely believe we (our generation) need to physically interact with each other more and learn to love each other more. We need to stop being so shallow. We need to have more genuine human connection\n",
      "- I've been told by a variety of people in my life that I act more maturely than the average person of my age. I believe that I'm more mature than a lot of people myself. I do not believe I am anywhere near the most mature being ever, but certainly above average. I know it sounds like I'm tooting my own horn, but judging by what others tell me and from what I believe, I think it's true.\n",
      "- I have very little patience for immaturity and childish behavior. I'm allergic to bullshit and stupidity (despite possessing the capability to be stupid myself sometimes)\n",
      "- I look and sound older than I actually am. \n",
      "\n",
      "And I think that's about it. \n",
      "\n",
      "Essentially, the tl;dr version of all of this is that I have antiquated and unconventional tastes in just about everything when compared to the average 19 year old college kid and it's hard for me to fit in with many people my age. \n",
      "\n",
      "I know the list kinda makes me sound like an conceited arrogant bastard, but I swear to you I'm not. I'm not trying to toot my own horn nor am I complaining exactly, I just felt the need to unload, and you know, this has been rather therapeutic to me, it's taken a load off my chest. Feel free to leave your thoughts (or not). If you made it this far (through the whole list), congratulations, you've reached the end. Give yourself a choccy. \n",

      "5363 I recently started wondering about the possibility of me being asexual. Friends say when you have a crush on someone, you’re supposed to fantasize kissing or having sex with them. However, when I have what I define as a crush, holding hands and having nice, long hugs are the farthest I can ever imagine. I can never picture having sex with anyone, and even when I force myself to do so, it just feels weird and I don’t want to keep thinking about it. I’m an 18-year-old girl, so can it be that I’m just not mature enough to experience sexual attraction? Or am I actually asexual?\n",

      "5390 My (slutty) confession: I'm a camgirl. It started when my exboyfriend showed me reddit asiansgonewild, and I figured I'd post there. There was this intense rush from the thought that somebody I knew (like hot guys) would be getting off to me, and I became one of the most popular posters on there. Eventually, I realized it would be worth it to monetize, so I started selling panties and while that was some nice extra spending money, I decided to take the leap to actually camming. I'm on one of the more popular sites and I rotate between that and another if there aren't a lot of viewers. I've been making around 2-3k a month extra just by spending a few hours on the weekends (and weeknights if no midterms) just masturbating on camera, I almost forget its there I just occasionally reply to the chat. I'd be so ashamed if my parents found out, and I just want you all to know I'm in your lecture hall with you, eating at the same places as you, and we have probably crossed paths at some point\n",
      "5391 It's a sad day when you find out that a person you used to date has removed you from their instagram. Idk why it hit me so hard but it just did. Being essentially erased from her life just by a click of a button on a screen. She was my longest and happiest relationship and we had to part ways while we still had feelings for one another. Our entire relationship was long distance and that coupled with me studying abroad for 1/2 a year led to us to come to the decision that maybe it's best, and more logical that we part ways. The part that hurt the most was the part where I had to hug her goodbye as I whispered to her, \"Thank you for the past year and 8 months\". *Kissed one last time* and she then got out of my car and walked back to her home. By far the hardest break up I've ever had to experience. Sometimes I'd like to think that is the reason why I'm not afraid to shoot my shot for anyone I'm interested in now, because nothing will hurt me as bad as that. I'm not sure where I'm going with this story, I was just letting my thoughts flow through my fingers. But don't worry about me. I believe I'm emotionally resilient. It's never a matter of \"if\" I'll be okay, but rather a \"when\" I'll be okay. I guess I just miss being in a relationship more today. Having someone to tell my day to, having someone's hand to hold, someone's forehead to kiss, someone's hair to smell after she takes a shower. The little things you know. That's all I have to say for today. Thanks for reading. Have a nice day ya'll :) \n",

I have a friend who does smoke sometimes, but I can't count the number of things they've done for me. Who cares if they rave or do drugs? If it's not hurting anyone (including second hand smoking or pressuring others which I do not condone), it's their life. College is hard, pressure hits, and everyone copes with it in their own way. Wholesomeness has become an overused word, but I think that having your friends say you're wholesome is not something trivial, it's because they view you as someone who has proven they can rely on, and that's pretty amazing in a society that is gradually becoming apathetic. \n",

Then after a couple months, he told me that he didn't want to use a condom and pulling out is safe, I said okay and we did that once but I told him that I didn't feel comfortable with it. Then the following two nights, I woke up with his penis inside of me and I didn't know what to do so I kind of stayed still until he pulled out. When I asked him whether he came, he told me he didn't but I didn't trust him. I didn't know what to do with what happened and I started finding him really repulsive. I hated my body because he used to pinch my waist with his hands and said that he would like me better if my waist was that skinny.

People often seem offended when I politely and discreetly decline their offer of alcohol or other things, and defensively ask why I choose not to drink. They then immediately proceed to either attempt to pressure me into it, or call me a variety of names to imply that I'm no fun. So I was wondering if anyone could tell me why people react this way to my choices? I never judge others for drinking, and I am happy that they have found a way to have fun/ relax that suits them.

They simply will not say they are struggling. They always have to justify it by flexing with how many orgs or project teams they're involved with, and stressing over \"low\" (really average or above) exam and homework grades. I've realized through personal experience that this is because if you show you are the weak link, others will be quick to abandon, and you quickly lose resources/ connections within the major. It's a sad fact that a lot of the people I've  observed here are only interested in connections that are beneficial to them in some tangible, academic way. I'm fortunate to have found some friends that are willing to get through this major together with an unconditional commitment to just helping each other in any way we can. But it's sad when I have other people in my major come to me to vent ( sometimes genuine) because they seem to feel like I won't \"drop\" them when they're other \"friends\" might. \n",

Her roommate was having a kickback with a decent amount of people while I was in a corner puking with my friend taking care of me. Because of the noise that the kickback made, a RSO came over and demanded to be let in so the girl throwing the kickback let him in.

All those times I wished the circumstances were different and I wasn’t the person I was back then. I don’t spontaneously cry or anything like that, but I’m very prone to making myself feel emotionally hurt. For the regretful things, it’s always something minor, like how I may come off a little bit savage or self-deprecate myself when joking around with friends. I try to make myself as amicable as possible, and sometimes it worked, but more often than not I end up hating myself for it in the future. In my mind, I’m always thinking of when I meet and get to know someone reasonably well, I’m setting myself up for disappointment later for the most minor things that I think most people forget about. Like, how one of my friends didn’t do too well on a midterm and I made a rude comment about it. I’m sure he didn’t hear it or he probably forgot it ever happened, but I still remember the moment very clearly and I continue to hate myself for it. I may seem emotionally weak or something, but I guess that’s the price I paid to be so sensitive to everyone’s feelings and words. \n",

I think the person who said the comment forgot, but I still remember the exact words of how it would be everything would be a bit more entertaining without me. On the outside, I tried to keep a straight face, and I did. On the inside, I get this person’s intention and I know this person didn’t mean to do anything wrong, but it’s moments like these that I can’t help but constantly reflect upon and hate myself for not being a different person, I guess.\n",

      "I keep asking myself if I’m a bad person for being capable of understanding other people’s emotions and intentions so well that I end up every comment to heart so much that it ends up hurting me. I made the mistake of hurting (and losing) past friends by making certain comments, even if they were never meant to hurt. I always apologized afterwards, but I can’t help but dwell on those moments. I vowed never to hurt anyone like that ever again. I’m very introverted, and I’m always considering other people’s feelings and thoughts over mine. I always try to be a nice person, helping everyone I can before I end up hurting. I just wished the circumstances were different, though. I don’t know why, I just do.\n",

I wish you were more concise in the way you treat me, that your actions match what you’ve been telling me from the very beginning.

      "I just want to tell you that you were wrong for over generalizing the space and clumping everyone into a single category. Just like many other orgs, KP has its owns pros and cons and to single out KP was just plain wrong. KP definitely provides a community for Fil-Ams and many felt/feels supported by this org and KP has retained them throughout undergrad. However, I will not deny that toxicity within the board space and the community do exists. You were right about instances when problems do not get solved because some people simply do not like to tackle the problem and likes to beat around the bush causing the problem to escalate and worsen. There are instances when it can be clique-y as well. As someone who's been in the space, I admit that there were times when I felt both supported AND unsupported. KP has its problems internally and that's the truth. I personally think that one of the biggest issues is that members of KP tend to deny this fact and do not want to tackle this issue and have a conversation on how we can make the space better. While I agree with those who commented on the original post defending KP, I think it's also important that we also recognize our own faults and work towards making the space better.\n",

We spend at most once a week together to eat lunch for the hour in between classes he has. It’s really not a full hour I get to spend with him since you have to calculate the time it takes to walk to and from class. But I’m okay with once a week, I think it’s healthy for us because we’re both busy and we need space from each other sometimes so we can learn how to be independent on our own rather than relay on each other for every single thing. But the reason I’m sad right now is because we planned to spend the whole day Saturday together. We didn’t hang out Valentine’s Day because we wanted to spend the Saturday together so we get the whole day instead of a day cut in half due to classes. This was planned more than a month in advance. So of course, I cleared my day out today so I could spend time with him. But I only got to spend a few hours with him. He wanted to leave early, not sure if it was because he wanted to study, play video games, sleep, hang out with friends, idk. If it was to study, I understand. We’ve always talked about academics being put before a relationship because they are extremely important. But I feel like we planned this in advance. He wants to make it up to me by buying me stuff like plushies or something. But I don’t want money being spent on me, I just want time to be spent on me for once. I don’t know if I’m asking for too much or not. He did buy me a nice lunch today but I didn’t ask for that and I tried to pay. So I feel like I’m just asking for too much.

      "5676 I don't meet any criteria to file for independent financial status but I don't get anywhere near my family's expected financial contribution, and my stepmom has chosen to still claim me as a dependent instead of allowing me to file my taxes independently because they get a better tax break (none of which goes to me). I don't have money for food, rent, car insurance or medical bills, and my disability has greatly diminished my ability to find work or balance a job with my education (I worked for quite some time and burned out, failed many classes). Any scholarships would simply reduce my other sources of financial aid as well. My step siblings get everything they need in terms of assistance, and while I understand that I can't just expect to be taken care of, this is really just an extension of the abuse my stepmom has directed towards me over the years. She's told me that I \"don't deserve\" the college savings my dad and mother had set aside for me, and so she has withheld all information on where this money is to prevent me from accessing it. She tried to kick me out at 17, and I very seriously considered trying to get emancipated from my family at the time but was told that I'd probably be 18 once the process was finished, and I'm frustrated that I didn't try anyway. I don't know what to do other than hope I can find some sort of employment that doesn't impact my ability to get school done or just accept that I'll be homeless soon. I'm so malnourished at this point that I've lost 40 pounds and collapse when trying to stand up a lot of the time. I don't know what my options are, I feel helpless.

I bought my partner a really really thoughtful gift and they put minimal efforts or thought into their gift for me for Valentine's Day. But its not just Valentine's Day, this has been a theme, where I am not as frugal as they are and I have always spoiled them. Communication is key in a relationship, but I think this could just be my expectations getting in the way, or them doing what their love language would like and me reflecting my love language on to them as well. So I don't know how to approach this kind of talk with them. I make comments about them making more money in the future and then it being my turn to be spoiled in a lighthearted way, but they react as if that's actually a joke. I appreciate all the other aspects of love and support and fulfillment I get from being in the relationship.

There’s nothing inherently wrong with approaching someone out of interest, but if you’re going to do it, be a normal fucking person and talk to them like you would any other person. Then you can gauge their reaction and based on that decide whether they’re ok being approached by you or not.\n",

      "I am interested in this lady who is a member of an org that I am also a part of. She is a very beautiful soul (and a very beautiful person in general); strong but emotionally sensitive with a zeal for life, an intellectual with similar interests to my own, and so very passionate about the org and the people in it. We don't know each other very well or are very close since she spent fall quarter away from UCSD and I've only known her since the start of this quarter (also, I'm relatively new to the org, having joined earlier this school year). \n",

I get so nervous around her that I absolutely lose my train of thought and my ability to make conversation (something I'm generally good at). This has never happened to me before in the past (at least with my recent interests). Second, it's difficult for me to be able to engage her anyway, since she's always flanked by her friends/org-mates before, during, and after these meetings (although we are connected on social media). Third, for reasons that are unclear to me, I don't get along very well with one of her really close friends and I'm afraid that this may lead to future complications. Fourth, she holds a leading position in the org, which may or may not cause problems if I go for it. And fifth, we don't have any classes together, so we only see each other at org meetings a couple times a week for a couple hours each time (with most of that time being dedicated to club-related activities).  \n",

      "To complicate matters further, I'm planning to leave the org soon to pursue other endeavors. In fact, if I had alternative means to reach out and connect with her, I probably would've already left. She's a year older than I am and graduating at the end of this school year and I feel like if I don't shoot my shot soon, I never will be able to shoot. My goose will be cooked and ready for serving, essentially.\n",

If I had studied hard and done everything I felt I needed to I’d be proud of myself. I haven’t even showed up to lecture for one of my classes and I don’t do the homework for that class. I studied for about 3-4 hours the night before and I got an A. I’ve also had similar bad habits for my other classes and I don’t understand why I’m doing so well. I’ve never been the type of person that doesn’t need to study for tests. Well, idk if this imposter syndrome or if everyone has gotten good grades this quarter (the averages for my midterms were all higher than 84%).

They’ve forgotten about basic things like how to get to certain places or how to operate simple things like the fridge or sink.

Naturally, I went with \"don't know.\"  I hang out in the common room a lot, since my roommate is always home when I am and I need some space. Unfortunately, the couple's room shares a wall with it.

I try my absolute hardest not to get sick and the SO (along with the suite-mate) has been sick this week, no hard feelings about that.

      "5801 Over the last few years I have half purposefully and half accidentally developed an eating disorder. Ever since I was 14 my body just doesn’t seem to want to be thin or skinny. Normally, without restriction or binging, we’re talking the doctor recommended 2000 calories a day with exercise during the week, my weight levels out in a weird place. For my height, I naturally stay at a BMI of 24 (for the friends who don’t know that’s just under being classified as overweight which is a BMI of over 25). I could never figure out why eating and exercising normally still leaves me at just under overweight. So I started working out more intensely and seriously watching what I eat and constantly paying attention to restricting calories. I’ve been maintaining/ losing weight and it’s great! But the amount of caloric restriction necessary to force my body to lose weight is crazy (like people and parents worry crazy). Also the amount I think about food and restriction is pretty all consuming. Get it? ;) I’ve been feeling an odd mix of maybe trying to get help for my developed food obesession, but I know if I’m told to eat normally I’ll just gain weight again which I really don’t want to happen. Is it wrong to almost enjoy having an eating disorder because weight loss made me feel more confident? I know this cannot be good for my mental health but with my weight in check and having good blood pressure and good grades I really feel like obsessing is helping me. This whole paragraph went in circles sorry. If anyone has any fitness or weight stories or sorrows they want to share I would love to read them.

      "Labon and Palmilla Dr bus stop students, it is raining and the line is long. I'm sure everybody knows where the line starts! When there is a HUGE line, it's very rude to cut everybody in line and go to the front, even if you live closer around IG. The line flows from the bus stop to around the corner FOR A REASON. The bus stops at the front, so if you stop at the front, you are getting in first. Normally when the 202 bus can fit everybody, it is still bad, but at least we can make it to school. When 4 full busses pass, and you get on before everyone else who has been waiting bus after bus, that is very wrong to just cut int the front! I would tell you to go to the back of the line, but since I was at the back, I could not go to the front. SO PEOPLE AT THE FRONT WHO MADE IT THERE, DO YOUR PART AND TELL THEM THAT THE END OF THE LINE IS OVER THERE BACK. If not for yourself, do it for the people who have been waiting bus after bus. \n",
      "The reason this needs to be addressed is because there was a line today, and because of ONE or TWO people, THE LINE WAS GROWING THE OTHER WAY. IT SNOWBALLS. So people who got here last, who don't know where the end of the line is, are at the beginning, and they get on the bus first! This doesn't make sense, just go to the back of the line. I come from the IG side, and I know it is unfair the end of the line is farther away, but you can't do anything about the fact that the bus runs the way it does. It stops at the first person at the bus stop. so logically the end is the OTHER side. \n",

My freshmen year I hooked up with this guy off Grindr and it was pretty hot. Let’s call him jack. I hooked up with him four more times over the past two years. The more I hung out with him, the more I realize jack was a shitty human being so I blocked him on Grindr. He then proceeded to make new accounts and tell me that he was going to find me and rape me. I was scared so I stopped using Grindr for a while. I downloaded it again today and this guy wanted to hook up. He was hot so I was down. I got to his place and turns out it was jack the whole time. He told me that all he wanted to do was talk. I was scared out of my mind and I felt like I was going to be killed. I listened to him ramble about how disrespectful I was, and how he thinks about me all the time. I told him I wanted to leave. Jack said he wanted to have sex with me one last time. I told him I didn’t want to. He told me that if I didn’t have sex with him, he was going to leak all my explicit photos all over ucsd and that he would keep pursuing me. If I had sex with him, then I would never see him again. I decided to have sex with him to get it over with. I wanted this to end.  I cried during it. He didn’t care. I just left his place.

I wish I didn’t feel like the female gender was so useless and only exists for a purpose that makes gag thinking about it. And I hate to feel this way. I don’t want to hate being a girl. Additionally, I’m not trans, I identify as female and do not want to medically or otherwise transition to male. I just wish that I could get my tubes tied or something since I don’t want to get pregnant ever and getting my period every month has been so horrible that I’ve been on birth control before I even turned 13. I hate the things the female body does on its own just for sake of fertility. It sucks. I hate being a girl but I don’t have dysphoira and I’m not trans. I’m stuck.

Anyways I’m not really sure where this is going anymore but I’m thinking about maybe fucking up one of the friendships for sex since we’ve actually already matched on a dating app. He’s also a fourth year so if I do end up fucking it up I won’t be seeing him on campus anymore.

Not to mention being more spontaneous; no having to scramble around looking for one then putting it on, by which time things aren’t as exciting. I feel blessed to have a partner who I trust and who loves it too. That said, respect for keeping safe 👊\n",

      "6004 I love my parents, but they arent helping me with tuition costs and it puts me in a really difficult spot. I can not apply for any student aid because my family earns too much money, which is sort of frusterating. I went to community college for two years to reduce the burden of student debt, and I worked 40 hours a week while I was a full time student so I could save up enough for UCSD. I was able to pay for the first 2 quarters ($16,000) on my own, but now my savings are virtually zero, and I barely have enough money to get by. I've built up some credit card debt and I work part time now to help reduce it. However, my debt will make applying for student loans difficult. I can not apply for any grants because of my family's income and scholarship money is usually reserved for low income students. I'm fortunate to be part of a somewhat wealthy family, but it is so frustrating to face a debt burden that most of my peers can ignore.\n",

I’m interested in commitment not a hookup. But, after being on tinder for about a year I’ve only had 25 matches compared to people who get 100+ after 2 days. I may still be overweight but I don’t think I look that bad? I hope I don’t. I’m super insecure about my appearance to the point where I don’t think I’ll find a significant other. I’m just trying to find someone to connect with and support. Apparently that’s too hard for me considering I’m Not “attractive.” Whenever I “shoot my shot” it always turns out bad. I don’t know what else I can do besides saying “I am human.” I have flaws and apparently those flaws hold me back.\n",

I'm not gonna mention names but I'm SO GLAD I made that call. #1, just because I'm fat doesn't mean I don't get to have standards so you're last point is just as retarded as you are. And yes, I got fat-sue me for eating twice my weight in tamales over break. #2, my main reason for dumping your bitchy ass was that you seemed way to emotional and invested in this. Lol if you had looked at my profile, you would have seen that I was looking for something casual. And I gave you at least 2 chances during the whole evening to move things along with me but you didn't and decided to \"stay for the encore\" and then \"say hi to my friends\". Tbh, I knew I was wasting my time with someone who wanted something different and I was hella nice to just tell you that I didn't want another date. And then you come here to bitch and moan about me judging you? You come here to insult my weight? Get off your god damn high horse and go to hell.

God whenever I feel like I want to get a SO, I read the horror stories that are all on this page and it makes me glad I don’t want sex. Because sex is apparently the only benefit to come out if the toxic sludge that is dating/ relationships.

It all played a part in my poor grades, but it's mostly that I never had good study habits. I could ace all my classes without doing most of the work in elementary and middle school, so why should I read anyway? I don't even know how the hell to study because I never really have.

      "So I had a date tonight. I met her online, we talked for at least a week, had a bunch of weirdly-specific common interests, and were enthusiastic about meeting up. She especially wanted to meet me, an had suggested seeing a show. So I bought tickets and we did. Admittedly, I was a little late, but I apologized profusely and she seemed cool with it. That was my only real fuck up. Anyway, due to the nature of the music (Indie rock), it went on until late and was fairly loud the whole time-we're weren't able to talk much. Then, I weirdly ended up seeing a couple friends from my HS (I'm from SD so it occasionally happens) so I talked with them for a hot couple minutes. After the show, I suggested getting some drinks or food...and she said she was tired. I kinda knew at that point, but she then flip-flopped and agreed to go to this small restaurant open late. So she then ends up standing me up there and lies saying that she was certain it was closed. As I'm there with a table. I apologize again for this apparently horrible date and ask if we could go on a better \"talking\" date to get to know each other. She refuses (I'll give her that she was polite about it) citing that I'm \"too extroverted and sociable\" for her. First off, I'm confused since I go to UCSD-I should be auto-classified as an introvert. Two, how did you judge my character after absolutely zero real conversations with me?! I'm not even mad she didn't want to date me, I'm just pissed that she judged me super rudely and didn't give me a chance. And of course, maybe she didn't find me attractive in person which is completely valid. Although it is a bit ironic coming from a person who was a good 25lbs heavier in person! And yet I didn't judge her. I gave her a chance to be beyond just a body. And I'm stuck with feeling a mix of anger at her judgement, and sadness that I offended/ strongly put her off somehow. What a wild world we live in.\n",
      "6092 Ok, I have been waiting for some of my petitions to get approved for forever now. Honestly it's getting really annoying. I'm a transfer and I have one more quarter and if none of them get approved I'll have to take five classes for Spring quarter. I just feel like not many of the counselors here are that great, at least not for sixth college. The art department is ok with counseling but have made some mistakes before that would have made me not graduate on time if I hadn't caught them. Not to mention I almost had to take freshman core sequence even though I came in as a junior. Sometimes it really seems like the counselors' jobs is to get the school more money and not help the students. The only reason that I'm graduating on time is because of all of the hard work and planning I did to make sure I can. It's just that everything takes forever and I've been given false information numerous times. Sometimes I don't even know why we have counselors considering I've had to do everything. I don't mind doing things myself but when you specifically set up an appointment and spend time to go see someone who is supposed to help you and then you are given information that isn't accurate it just makes things worse than they would have been if there weren't any counselors at all.

So after smoking It felt like everyone was staring at me cause A) I made it smell B) I made it hot or C) all of the above. But then again at this point it looked like everyone was faded/crossed/ or hella drunk so it could of been the alcohol and not enough air circulation.

I was just trynna have a good time and make friends cause idk most of the people and i am a  transfer student. Idk dude. It either I am hella paranoid or just thinking about it too much. But also while in ride back home, this girl I was with did say she was lowkey mad and noticed others as well were because it seemed like i made the house hotter than it was.

We spent the day with one of my long-time friends and she was so uncomfortable with us that she stayed quiet the whole time and told me later that it was \"too much\" and she'd never felt more like a third wheel despite the fact that we're not an item.

I can't find the lines between platonic and romantic and any other kind of love you want to list, and I don't know if it's because they've been indulging my desire for physical affection or because of something actual, something concrete. I can't let this drag the both of us down, can't let myself depend on them too hard and make myself incapable of function on my own, can't burden them with my strange crises and muddled feelings.

We texted over snapchat and whenever I texted her she would immediately reply, which to me is a sign that she is interested or something like that. Also she wanted to follow me on every social media, which to me was fine. But then yesterday she told me that she felt that she didn't knew me even though that we've been talking for months and that she wanted to go on a date. I then told her that the problem was that she never continued any conversation and that she has never put any effort into knowing me. I then explained her that I hate whenever a person doesn't continues a conversation and that I just simply ignore that type of people. She then got mad and said, well you're not even interesting or attractive for me to put a lot of effort.  I'm honestly glad that I stopped talking to her because I think that kind of behavior is just mere toxic. She probably just wanted the attention or what do you guys think? \n",

She snaps at us and holds grudges against us but she just keeps saying that everything is fine. Its really hard to have conversations with her and talk about her shortcomings  (something the rest of us do with each other at least every once in a while) because she either gets really offended or internalizes all of it and turns it into \"Yeah I know I'm\n",

Also she gives us no room for mistakes - if we say or do one little thing wrong, even if it's just a slip of the tongue, she holds it against us.

There’s no way I can ever get it back. This idea drives my self-esteem and morale into the ground. It may not seem so major to others but to me, it’s everything. It symbolizes my life and now that I lost it, I feel like a waste of space and time. That everything and everyone that made me, me, until that moment I lost it was thrown away. There are people there for me but I don’t want to burden them. I want to deal with it on my own. It was all my fault and therefore my responsibility. I disappointed everyone, and I can’t reverse it.

      "As you have probably guessed, I am quite prone/sensitive to yeast infections and I have successfuly kept them at bay, which makes my life much better, and I know others probably struggle with it too (or the opposite issue, BV).\n",
      "\n",
      "Firstly, if you do have penetrative sex, for the sake of your yeasty friends not overpopulating your cupcake, lube up! A LOT. There cannot be too much lube! Also try not to have penetrative sex too frequently (but if you do, lube the heck up!)\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, you know how a lot of us with boobies will take off our bra first thing we come home? I started doing that with my undies as well! (And I sleep with no undies now as well too) Invest in lots of long skirts/dresses so you can let your hoo-ha breathe, even when you're out and about! \n",
      "(With the exception of when/if you menstruate unless you use tampons/cups then yay! You can let your flippy lips out all month long!)\n",
      "\n",
      "Personally I don't have much of a sweet tooth, but if you do, try to limit it or supplement with plain yogurt (yes, plain plain, none of that sweet yogurt). It's healthy and helps cultivate some healthy bacteria pals for your yeasties. You can also take probiotic pills but I think just eating better is a healthier option.\n",
      "\n",
      "These simple things have kept the bakery at bay (especially the not wearing undies as much as possible). I hope this is helpful to someone who is looking to improve their coochie's health! This stuff happens and shouldn't be embarassing to talk about. ❤ \n",

However, if I hadn’t taken something similar before I wouldn’t have understood the concepts either. Her questions weren’t “stupid”. However, this dude near me kept whispering about how her questions were stupid and unneccessary and how she was dumb. \n",

      "So to this dude and whoever else thinks this way : NO she’s not stupid. She’s confident for speaking up.

Despite any problems or flaws they might have, I still love them all, but I fear that the end is near. I wish I could do something but I know that I would just make everything worse. I would appear selfish for wanting everyone to stay together just so that I, myself, can be happy. What should happen is that everyone else should be happy before me because they matter so much to me that I would rather be sad and them happy than the other way around. I’m not looking for advice.

We hooked up again after we played Smash and had some drinks. But this time it felt more emotional. So real. It wasn’t just an emotionless hookup. He said he wanted to come back and spend the night with me. But i had never thought of him that way until that first night we made out. We were just sitting and he started to say some things about life that made me go “okay i wanna kiss you”. The next hour here we were naked on my bed talking about stuff... so a few days later I texted him and said I want to talk to him. I was planning to tell him that I wanna leave some doors open instead of strictly being fwb. Not right away ofc it’s so new! But I wanted him to know that  I am okay with seeing if things can go further. he didn’t know what I was gonna talk about because I was so discreet about it. Yea anyways he just messaged me and said “hey lets meet tomorrow im going to my ex’s house now.” Oof. I am happy for him because he is my friend but I mean...FUCK THIS AWCH MY HEART 💔💔 He is such a great guy. One of the very few straight guys that I know who are actually sensitive about the world issues and sensible in general sense. He has a way of conserving a good amount of happiness and self love within himself at all times. I haven’t spent so much time with him yet but I am good at reading people.

Watching porn without pursuing girls means that you would rather watch other people have sex than have sex yourself. 💪 you can do it. \n",

Seriously come on people, stop hanging out with chinese because you are chinese, stop hanging out with white people because you are white. Seriously Please be more open minded and willing to talk to people that sit next to you during your lecture. I have offered handshake to this guy and yes my hands was in the air. I love the atmosphere and environment, and all students hardworking. But you guys really need to work on your social skill. Because I'm trying it too and I'm sure you want to make more friend who can give value to you. Let's be friend, and who knows one day he/she can be your best friend. Nothing is better than having a great people around you and I'm sure you want one. \n",

It’s all over my legs, arms, torso and part of my face. It drives me batshit up-the-wall insane all day and all night because I’m just so damn itchy all the time and it’s just pure agony. It stresses me out so much which then triggers my eczema to flare up even worse and my skin becomes a circle jerk of eczema just fucking me up. Sometimes it’s so frustrating (especially in dry ass winters) I just want to either skin myself and live as a wendigo in the mountains or just plain delete myself. I wish it would just go away but there’s no cure.

      "6309 I think that AP Tests provide all sorts of accessibility issues. I know that there are reduced price AP Tests so that poor people can still take them without having to shell out $70 a test. But it also comes down to what classes are offered by a school. If a school is small and poor, obviously there won’t be enough funds to offer a wide variety of AP classes. Yes I know that we can study on our own and try to take the test, but that didn’t work for me and I’ve heard many anecdotal stories of how people would have definitely failed the AP test if they didn’t have their class. Now it’s great that there are so many scholarships and stuff for 1st gen and people from low socioeconomic status to go to college. (Time for the rant part of this) It’s just not fucking fair that some (not all, I know) poor people have no AP credit, not because they failed the test or didn’t want to take the classes/test. I didn’t even know there was a whole other level of IB credit until I got to UCSD. I know that I probably didn’t work as hard as other kids who had access to these advanced classes, but fuck. I’d love to be able to take 12 units a quarter and maybe pick up a minor if I wanted to instead of taking 1,000 units a quarter and just trying to graduate on time because financial aid greatly goes away after a 4th year. All because my high school only offered 2 AP classes and it’s not uncommon for people to come in with like 40+ units.\n",

I have never heard the tone of the voice before and usually she (it sounds like a woman’s voice) says things like: “You are a disappointment to your parents.” “You will be a failure.” “You will never amount to anything.” I don’t know if it’s the guilt of not having the best grades since I’ve been to college or I just have an overactive imagination or I actually am going crazy.  \n",

I still sometimes get these random moments of guilt that I accidentally robbed my elementary school. I think I have the book back home somewhere. The pictures are still pretty cool\n",

      "So I just watched Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse and I thought, as a self-proclaimed film buff, it is one of the best animated movie I have ever watched. I thought the movie does an excellent job in recreating NYC scenery, and each character was so well made, both in terms of animation and character development. So much well made that it mades me fall in love with Spider Gwen (Ghost Spider).  No, this is not the character fandom love that I am referring to. I mean a somewhat sexual but to a greater extent platonic love like with a real-life human. After I watched the movie I have this childish desire to make mine own particle accelerator like one in the movie and travel in Gwen's universe so I could be with Gwen and makes her mine. No, I don't want to date real life cosplay doppelgänger of Spider Gwen. I want to be physically live in the animated Earth-65 universe with animated Spider Gwen. Ironically, I am realistic and pragmatic human being in the real world who never have such weird fantasy in any aspects in my life.  Plus, I never like hentai because of its sickened view of love, i.e love without reciprocation, consent, responsibility and effort. I have been having this fantasy since after the day I watched the movie and felt terrible for having it. I felt futile since my love for Gwen is as real as it gets for a fictional animated characters that made with deterministic human personalities (i.e personalities that in fact are not the consequence of free will but are determined by the producers and the voice actor) and physical look right in the sweet spot of uncanny valley. In other words, it is absurd to have a human love with an inhuman character just because it has seemingly perfect set of human qualities . Even if I even disregard this philosophical-emotional hybrid dilemma, my frustration still stems from the fact it is physically impossible to send at my consciousness into a digital world that would be the animated universe.   If you are a bit of a film buff yourself, my predicaments are similar with the plot of the movie Her but only thing that is different is these feelings are real. For now, I have been blocking any thoughts about Spiderman in general so that I can get rid of this fantasy and hope that by writing this eccentric piece of confession it will help speed up the process because I don't want to be the same person that I disdained to be.\n",

      "6375 I have a 3.89 GPA in STEM with a supposed 'bright' future and I want to kill myself. I have some good friends now, but i'm so fucking lonely. I just want somebody to share my feelings with and feel comfortable around. The last time I was in a real relationship, it turned out to be a co-dependent mess where we both treated each other terribly. Yet, even through all those manipulations, fighting and misdeeds, there were still days where I felt like I could comfortably feel like myself. It's really unfortunate, but I actually feel drawn back to that shitty relationship. No one else will accept me romantically because I have strong feelings (also because I don't fit my gender mold in a sexual sense either). In contrast, my ex encouraged my strong feelings. She would do everything to push my buttons, intimidate me, and control me. Everything feels so hopeless because I know I shouldn't go back to that kind of relationship. But I have this sinking feeling that the only kind of person who would ever be interested in me is because they know they can take advantage of my strong feelings. Otherwise, strongs feelings are indicative of a degenerate, which non-degenerate people know to avoid.\n",

I noticed that I was accidentally making eye contact or catching people staring at me and my friend. nobody was looking at the straight couple. I guess that’s typical, but I still felt horrible. Ashamed, almost (thought I know I have nothing to be ashamed about). I felt like I can never be with another woman out in public, even on this liberal, californian university. how am I supposed to show affection for a girl I really like (I don’t mean heavy PDA, just handholding and being together) if I feel that exposing feeling of everyone’s eyes on me??

      "6416 So I came to UCSD as an engineering major to get my four years of hell done and then find a job. I’m a current second year who’s had no intention of going to grad school. I found out this week that my mom wants me to go to grad school. (And to stop all the people who say I shouldn’t feel pressured by my parents, in high school I was taking college classes along with high school and my mom only wanted me to take one class while my dad wanted me to take two. My mom never spoke up about it so I took two. If she would have said anything I would have dropped one class in a heart beat. If my dad said he wanted me to go to grad school (which I’m sure he would) I would laugh in his face and say no). All I really aspire to be is a mother of 5+ dogs in a simple, comfortable house. I know in my heart I can find the brute strength to power through grad school (and be the first one in my extended family to get a PhD). I’d also have enough time that I wouldn’t be playing catch up to get on the same level as everyone else who wants to go to grad school (RIP pre meds). But going to grad school is a lot of work and motivation that I don’t really want to deal with. I’m also not really sure who I can talk to in order to completely work out my feelings about it and make up my decision. Like, is it even worth it to go to grad school as an engineering major?! I’d like to make my decision sooner rather than later to 1) stop the unnecessary stress of making the decision and 2) if I end up deciding to go to grad school to get my shit together and start studying for the GRE\n",

I constantly feel like I'm just being awkward and need to just relax but I want to try harder to reach out, but it's hard because I don't want it to seem forced or fake. It's hard to make your way into a friend group that's already tight. I try to remind myself that it's probably just that they think I'm busy and have other things to do, but seeing them always hanging out, having fun, etc. makes me feel like they enjoy themselves more when I'm not around. I just want to let you know that you're not alone in feeling this way though.\n",

I've considered reporting the fraternity to national so many times. It's ridiculous. The frat tries too hard to act like a 'social' frat and to build 'brotherhood'. Like for our most recent class we forced the pledges to eat spicy noodle ramen and memed about it. I've heard in the past we've made classes eat things like chocolate covered onions and whole jars of peanut butter. I don't get why, we're supposed to be a professional fraternity. Can we stop trying to pretend like we're an MGC? TT always says everything in the pledging process has a reason or purpose but I see no reasoning for physical hazing. \n",

It was right of her to try to seek out help if she feels that she is struggling, because some people really do need that extra help and push at the beginning. This is especially after months of celebrities committing suicide such as Kate Spade and Anthony Bourdain in the news, and the general consensus that self-esteem and mental wellness is a big issue in our generation, so as aspiring physicians (most of you) I hope you all would take that into account.

I've had major depression for the last 9 years.

I never thought I would make it this far. I never thought I wanted to make it this far.

On NYE the memory of me standing on that hill crying with pain and happiness flooded back to me. I thought about all that I have done since then and how much stronger I've gotten.

I try to advise this friend and take care of them but they never take my advise or really care about my actions. It’s always about them. I don’t expect anything for what I’ve done by all means but it breaks my heart knowing that the one friend I thought would be my best friend for life probably won’t be.

On the other hand, I don’t have any close high school friends or close friends in general to talk to. I really don’t know what to do. Everything and everyone is turning out to be toxic and I just feel really alone. I don’t know what else to do.

I only realized that I was bi in junior year and even after that it hadn't clicked that I felt that way about her, and whenever I tried to make a move she was with this dick. There was one time I drove to her house and made out with her in her driveway as he was on his way over, and there have been times where we cuddled and she flat out told me she'd fuck me, and times where she flirted with me, but it never really worked out. She apparently had very deep feelings for me when we were much younger, when I was so closeted that being gay wasn't even a thought, but she doesn't feel anything more than the friendship and sexual attraction at this point. It's easier to move on now that I'm in a different area, but being home has me thinking so much about her!!

So when he messaged me after I didn't wanna respond to any of his messages and was hoping he'd get the hint because I felt like he wouldn't take it well if I told him I didn't have a good time and he ended up sending me messages to guilt me into responding telling me I was a bad person for not replying and stuff and so I just blocked him.

I keep meeting nice people at school who like me and I like them too but then I remember these events and immediately start pushing them away and it makes me feel like shit but it's because I don't want anyone to ever go through that nor do I want to go through that ever again.

The fact that he didn't pressure me, told me it was okay to say no, and waited for my answer without giving me any shit was honestly so great. Like it's the decent thing to do, but I haven't always been treated with that respect, and looking back I'm so grateful that my first sexual experiences were actually positive. We've moved on but it was a great relationship overall, I don't regret anything. \n",

He asked if I was okay and stopped pretty quickly, but I've had problems with intimacy ever since. I still feel so uncomfortable, anxious, and guilty about the situation.

      "6602 These past two weeks have been an emotional rollercoaster for me. I always have a hard time making friends and/or staying in a friend group because I am extremely bad at knowing what is appropriate in a social context and because I am an extremely annoying person. What I am saying is, I feel bad for being insensitive to certain friends/acquaintances somewhat, but I'm glad to have a small number of friends who accept and understand me, both at home and at university atm, but usually I end up being triggering to a lot of people. During winter break, I ended up talking to a senior in high school (I am first year, and I had a crush on him for a while a few years ago). We ended up Netflix and Chilling and I had a really great time, but immediately after it was over, he told me that he didn't really enjoy it and that he just wasn't ready (nothing wrong with me). \n",

      "6603 I really want to quit UCSD, and life in general. I am really depressed and I don't feel like things are really worth it anymore. I made many mistakes in the past which give good reasons for the people in the past to not like me. Yet even as I try to move on from those mistakes, I somehow get the feeling that everyone knows and that there is this conspiracy wherein everyone dislikes me now. If I ask people why they don't like me (after they showcase apathy), they don't even provide a response so I have no idea what I am doing wrong. Am I too ugly? Am I too stupid? Do I not have the social media clout that everyone else has? Even in trying to be positive with people, I feel like they respect me even LESS when I do so. How can I be a more positive person when positivity is the very thing that pushes everyone away? These social concerns are the precise reason why I am afraid to leave school because honestly I am screwed when it comes to living my own independent life. Nobody will talk to me, and the social isolation will probably lead me to becoming jobless and homeless. So I cling to school even though it is rapidly coming to an end and I am not enjoying it. In some respects, I do want to quit school, and I can because I have satisfied the requirements for a different degree than the one I am working on. Yet I am screwed once school ends. It doesn't matter that I have a good gpa. I already know that I will not be able to make it through a job. I am already failing at making it through an internship. And ultimately, nobody will care. I will just become another statistic: the 'depressed homeless individual' of which there are countless many. I can't go into details about my past, but I can tell you that it was fucked up (much of it of my own doing, and much of it not of my own doing). And now, everything just seems hopeless. I feel like if people did care, maybe, just maybe, I could have a chance to survive. But at this point, I really have my doubts. \n",

      "6668 I've been taking ungodly amounts of adderall just to barely make it through school. If I don't take adderall I fail my classes. If I do take adderall multiple times a week I get, at the least, passing grades. I take anywhere between 60-120 milligrams of adderall in one dose, at least 4 times a week. There have been nights where I stared up at my ceiling while lying in bed, my heart pounding dangerously close to 200bpm and my eyes open as wide as possible, where I was convinced I was going to die of a heart attack within the next few hours. Absolutely convinced and waiting for death. I've always dismissed my adderall usage as necessary to be a functioning member of society, but when I'm on adderall I become a reclusive, borderline psychotic person, clenching my teeth so hard that their alignment becomes disfigured and don't fit together properly anymore so I can't even bite down at all anymore. When I work on adderall, my work is not about getting the work done, it is about writing with the perfect handwriting. If I write any character that doesn't look exactly how I want it, I erase and rewrite till it looks perfect. When I work on adderall, my work is not about getting the work done, it is about doing the problems that I actually understand over and over again just to make myself feel good about the fact that I understand a problem and like the way it looks when I solve it on paper. Not to mention that every time I take adderall it is not to get work done, it is simply to feel that jolt of motivational energy that makes it feel like anything that I do is productive and worthwhile. This means sometimes I take adderall and play single-player video games secluded in my room for 8-9 hours at a time. (I beat Red Dead Redemption 2 in five days, all side quests, legendary animals, and main story missions complete). I don't see an end to my adderall usage anywhere in the near future. My life revolves around adderall, I've stolen money from my parents to get adderall, I've lost friends due to adderall, my sober mind is always thinking about the next time I can take adderall. My lies about my life and usage are what caused my girlfriend of three years to break up with me. When I'm sober, I miss her so much that it physically hurts. So I take adderall just to be able to get my mind on other things. By other things I mean get my mind to obsess over one singular thing for 8-10 hours of the day before I inevitably crash and feel the need to either take more adderall, or \"sleep.\" Moral of the story I guess, be very careful with adderall cause it can get its clenches on you and never let go.\n",
      "6669 Tldr; my boyfriend and I have different religious beliefs, send help. Muslim advice needed for confused outsider .-.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The other day, my boyfriend and I were talking about bringing our relationship out to the public, which is something he’d be terrified to do because he is Muslim. I was born into a catholic family, practiced christianity for a bit, and am not ashamed to admit that right now I’m confused and still wondering what religion I believe in the most.  For a bit of context (and I don’t pretend to know everything about this which is why I’m seeking advice) the “correct” (?) way to find your wife would be for your family to set you up with someone under the same religion, you court them, and then you marry. No room for ‘dating’ an outsider like me. (With the exception of MAYBE if I was very Christian? People of scripture? Apparently there are exceptions type of thing, someone please clarify) Well see WHOOPS, we fell in love. WHOOPS. \n",
      "\n",
      "Well now when we for real get deep and talk about us in the context of religion, etc, he says he is torn between two ideas. 1) Knowing that this feels right and that in the end, whether it be marriage or whatever it may be, that it will turn out ok. Things would work out, maybe I’d even become muslim, or not, (because right now I really don’t know what I am) but that in the afterlife there wouldn’t be punishment for loving someone like this. OR 2) This “feels right” because it’s a distraction from Shaytan, or in other words Satan, who is making him feel as though something this wrong can actually be okay. And it’s something he’s supposed to recognize as a trick or deception? \n",
      "\n",
      "I’m understanding, but it honestly hurts to be in love with someone who for a lack of a better word, is so unsure. I told him that if I went to confession, I don’t think a pastor would tell me I’m wrong for being in love with him. Or that I should break it off. And I asked if there was anyone that he could talk to … And he said that he knows they would tell him that it’s improper and to break it off and that he knows that, just doesn’t want to hear it. I get so hurt thinking someone could believe in something that could teach that love like this is so wrong… but then again to him, Allah is a metaphysical thing that is above everything we know and feel and so it makes sense that his message is universal and above what we may be feeling. \n",
      "\n",
      "This rarely gets in the way, we don’t fight, we even talk about religion occasionally, and it’s never a negative experience. It’s just the residual feeling of sadness I get thinking he’s scared of this. \n",
      "\n",
      "I guess my question is more for the Muslim community. Give me perspective. Give me advice. Am I supposed to want to push him away for his own beliefs? Or what am I supposed to think. Have you as a Muslim ever accidentally fallen in love with someone outside of the Islamic belief system? What is he or I supposed to do according to your beliefs? And Christians, what about you? \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "To anyone who may think: “If he loves you, he’d change,” no. Please don’t even comment. I’ve come to learn and respect his ideas wholeheartedly. Love or any human feeling does not trump the word of Allah to my man and though it’s not something I fully understand, I stand by him and support his decision to believe that. \n",

Bitch, please, the only reason girls wear makeup is too look less ugly/more attractive than the other girls; it's all a fucking game. Luckily, guys weren't historically and systematically berated like women, so we never adapted to making ourselves look like clowns, but it still depresses me to see dudes attracted to girls with a caked-on face. The most gorgeous girls on this campus are the ones who don't wear makeup (shows prioritizing living life and caring about adult shit like your grades and job), and the absolute bottom of the barrel are the girls who look day and night if you hit em with a bucket of soap and water. Girl, I don't give a fuck if you have acne/bad skin/whatever. Better to see and touch real skin than look at a face decorated by a mortician. inb4 makeup is empowering/beautiful (it's not, it's glorified face paint), helps girls feel comfortable in their own skin (false sense of security/well-being), ubiquitous throughout the world (women are oppressed throughout the world), etc...\n",

      "6709 To the person at OVT who ordered an apple kale smoothie \"vegan, no ice\", you are the worst kind of customer! As if giving the cashier attitude wasn't enough, you have the audacity to stand by the counter, your eyes constantly creeping over the people trying to make your smoothie, when literally every seat in the restaurant is empty. Your \"no ice\" request fucked with the portions of the smoothie, so we're sorry we took a bit longer than usual to fill it up to the cup's rim. And when we finally fulfill your request to make that special smoothie, you come up to the counter again with your entitled ass and say \"I don't want it anymore\", just as we're filling the cup! You only waited like 7 minutes but go off and tell us how \"we made you late.\" Enjoy your six dollar refund, you hoser.

      "6736 I am so tired of being at this stupid fucking school and continuously getting fucked over for being mentally ill.  I have been in and out of therapy for the past few years and ever since my first suicide attempt, which occurred on campus, my grades kept getting worse until I was eventually academically disqualified.  I took some time off and eventually took courses at a CC for a year and I was able to reapply to UCSD and be readmitted. This has been my first quarter back at UCSD after almost 2 years and the fucking hoops I have had to jump AFTER being readmitted have been ridiculous. First, the readmission process took FOREVER and by the time they readmitted me, all the classes had been filled and I had to take almost all electives because those were the only classes with open spots. Secondly, the financial aid office put me on probation and said I would have to pay my fees out of pocket each quarter until they could review my grades and decide if they will give me my loans for each quarter. Before I even started my Fall quarter, I had to borrow almost 5k from my boyfriend so I wouldn't be dropped from all of my classes and I will have to continue doing this before each quarter starts or else I will be dropped from everything and have to waitlist. Mind you, I am now a senior so I can't afford to be dropped from classes and get on a long ass waitlist for all of my classes. Thirdly, my major counselor fucked me over and told me to sign up for a class that I did not meet the prerequisites for so when I tried to sign up for this class, I couldn't. I told her about it and she said I will need to sign up for a 199 instead since I couldn't sign up for this research course on WebReg. How the fuck am I supposed to find a professor that will take a 199 student with an almost nonexistent GPA? And 2 quarters of this is required for my major. Fourthly, my grades came out for this quarter and even though my quarter GPA should have me in good standing, I just got a message telling me that I am subject to disqualification again because my cumulative GPA is still shit but even if I had received a 4.0 for this quarter, my cumulative GPA would have still been below a 2.0 so I don't how they expected me to pull my cumulative GPA up so much after just one quarter back??? I just feel like they are going to kick me out again even though I am trying to pass all my classes, keep my job so I can afford my rent, and do all of this while managing my mental illness pretty much on my own because my Kaiser therapist can only see me once every other month. I just feel like I keep getting punished for being disqualified and having Bipolar even though I did my best to come back and finish up my degree. What else are they expecting me to fucking do!?

She refused multiple times and told him to let her out of the room multiple times, but he wouldn't and basically cornered her. After telling her what happened, she just said \"yeah he's just a pushy person\" and compared it to him peer pressuring his friends to drink (like wtf this isn't even on the same level).

You’ve helped me through one of the most uncertain periods of my life. I’m not gonna lie - I dont deserve you baby - I really don’t. You were there for me high and low and now I want the chance to be there for you as well. You’ve helped me when I wasn’t sure of what it even meant to love. You were with me when I kissed someone else when half drunk - sure u were as angry as hulk and ik the incident hurt u way more than you let on in front of me - but I’m fortunate that you didn’t leave me in that treacherous time.\n",

      "A lot of this is really personal to me and the only reason I’m posting it on a page like this is because I want to encourage people to learn from the mistakes I’ve made and from the things my baby did right. Through this past year I’ve learned that to be in love with someone is more than the moments you share with them, the songs you both jam to, the hours you spend studying before a final, the crazy adventures you take with one another. To love someone is to believe in someone else. To love is to forgive and persevere. I’m not saying that everyone should be forgiven for whatever wrong doings they do in a relationship. But I am saying that it’s unfair to keep posing hypothetical questions about why things will fail, instead of posing the hypothetical question what if things work. I made that mistake and my girlfriend was strong enough to stick by me through each high and low - and for that I am grateful. I wish I could be more like you baby. \n",

I can’t force you to take me back. And I can’t promise that the road from here-on-out is gonna be flowers and roses. But baby it’s taken me some time to understand you’re the only one I wanna go down this road with. Because you’re the one I believe in now.\n",

If people who do not take drugs to study can get through their classes without extra help, good for them, but if there are people who need extra things to focus it is okay. different drugs have different effects on people. Maybe coffee does not help someone stay up/focus, but taking something stronger like adderall  does help.

Everything has been genetically modified for thousands of years) is actually worse for the environment bc they take up more space and yield less than gmos crops. If the market for organic food continues to expand, we will see prices go up and the amount of food available go down, which hurts third world farmers the most. It just frustrates me when I see these people eating organic when they barely know what that means and the consequences that come with it.\n",

Anyways, she needed to get a pill, but I'm in another country now, and in this country I guess it's very difficult and expensive to get a pill.

The reason I feel the need to say this is not to make people feel bad, but to not allow them to have false notions of themselves.

It's honestly a constant struggle because I go back and forth about the situation pretty frequently. I don't want him to control my actions on the matter because if he wasn't the way he was then I probably would drink just like any other college student. But I can't help but feel like a hypocrite. I grew up hating what he was and that alcohol was the thing that made him that way. That's properly the main reason why I don't want to drink (but also I just dont like the weird looks that people give me because I choose not to. Like let me live my life lol).

It's been 4 holiday seasons since I left home for college and I can't explain why I always feel this way towards them. I simultaneously feel as if I want to avoid them at all costs in order to avoid the incredible potentially awkward situation from occurring, and, that I want to see them again to just hang out and catch up. And I know this is all wrong; you have to get over your past for God's sake! But...as they say you never forget your first love and when I'm surrounded with the rosy-colored glasses of home nostalgia, I can't seem to fully forget.

I am in the most toxic relationship of my life and I had an overdose as a result of it over the weekend. I went to hospital, got checked out and convinced the doctor I would be fine to go home and be under supervision (that I don’t have) the next day.  I had all the motivation to go home write my papers and graduate this quarter but as soon as I got home from the hospital my bf went in the room to scream at me and blame me for things regarding his mental health. I know at times I have been horrible to him and maybe I deserve this treatment but I had just left the hospital for depression and had begged him to let me focus on my exams for the next couple of days. I had such a large panic attack i vomited. He tried again this morning but i shut it down before it began. I literally feel like i can’t take this anymore and I’ve lost all the motivation i had while in the hospital (+still in pain from pills). I want to leave desperately and would have the support to do it but I can’t help but to feel immensely guilty because he is struggling so much right now. How can you leave someone you love when they are at their lowest? Specially when you have helped contribute to their depression, debt and overall shit predicament. So yeah that one out of the 1,000 problems I am dealing with right now.   \n",

We’ve been snapping back and forth until he (inevitably it seems like) asked me for nudes. Now I would likely have sex with this tinder boy as he is very cute and not an asshole (yet). I’m also okay with the idea of sending nudes, in theory. To me, like it’s very flattering that some random guy off the internet wants to jack off to pictures of my boobs (without my face) vs almost anything else on the Internet. I also like the idea that with Snapchat you (supposedly) send the picture to one person and it vanishes. The only thing is one of my ex’s kept my nudes without telling me. We were exchanging nudes, I’d prefer him to jack off to me instead of random porn stars especially if I was unable to see him for a week or more (like a trip). I would send pictures over Snapchat and after awhile he asked if he could keep some. I said yes and to screenshot them off of Snapchat so I know what he has. A few weeks later he showed me the calculator app where he had all my nudes and there were a lot more than what I had seen him screenshot. Turns out he had a special app that let you take screenshots of peoples snaps without letting them know. I felt kind of violated. Like my condition was simple, screenshot to let me know what you have. So basically I probably would have sent this tinder boy nudes but I don’t trust guys with nudes anymore. Now he’s left me on read for a few hours so I guess this is the end of our attempt at a relationship which is really a bummer because I was getting too attached. Anyways if you’ve made it this far and feel comfortable sharing your opinion, what do you guys (guys as in everyone) think about sending nudes and/or sending them to tinder boys?\n",

It gives me a kaleidoscope of emotions, the songs all blend it to one piece of music, it has to be listened to in order to be understood. The first little bit is quite weird i always felt disorientated when i first started listening to it, then around 5 mins i always feel my anxiety, waves are sweeping up and down my body, i always wonder how long it will go on for. Back it comes, the laughs sound like voices....    Back home when i just started smoking weed when i was 16 me and my two best mates would all ways get supper stoned and then just lay their in  silence with head phones on listening to it full blast. One top tip is to stay up really late till about 4am and you must have got up early that day. Then at 4am smoke more weed than you have ever done before literally push your limits, take like 10 dabs, then listen to this with headphones in or a loud speaker and every time you feel yourself about to sleep you turn the volume up. After all this, you go into this weird hypnotic state, where it feels like your essence has become this piece of music. BTW this album is good with or without drugs - but of course the greatest piece of music should be appreciated from many different angles, each time you learn something different about yourself and the world around you.

She now lives with another mutual friend, but next year she, myself, and my first roommate all want to live together.

Another suitemate brought it up and the culprit chimed in with \"yeah whoever keeps doing it needs to stop; soap doesn't even kill the bacteria it just rinses it off\". Okay, I understand if he has OCD or something and it's just soap but at least take responsibility than blatantly lying about it, making yourself look like a hypocrite. I know ppl with nasty roommates would much rather be in this situation than their current one, but I just wanted to provide a totally opposite example.

There’s consistently at least one fine ass girl every time I come here (and it’s finals so I’m in the library a lot). That also goes for the guys there too (British guy and black dude are pretty good looking guys, and I’m straight)  but have y’all also noticed there’s also like hardly any guys that work there at all? Also virtually NO white women? The only saving grace to this atrocity (as I prefer white women) is the really nice blond one, but like is there some diversity quota or something? I’m just curious. I don’t think it’s a problem but also I just want to be able to flirt with a white hottie who isn’t unavailable. (That’s honestly my biggest problem, the tall blond girl who is 100% my type is definitely taken. I guess I’m just lonely?) What are your thoughts? Also who is your favorite Audrey’s employee? \n",
      "7052 i liked someone but i knew they didn’t feel the same and it wasn’t meant to be, but they told me about some really serious things and so i wanted to help them. i thought they knew i respected them as a friend and I didn’t have any ulterior motives when offering support, but recently i read this article about how sometimes people have a hard time saying no because they’re scared of retaliation or having their reputation ruined if they have to reject someone (this person confided a lot in me). now i feel like maybe they were just keeping in contact with me to be polite, but there were all these times where conversations could have ended and they continued things, or they said things that sounded borderline romantic as if they knew that was what i wanted to hear. i didn’t respond to these things because i wanted to keep things platonic, but i took this as an indication that they wanted to continue the friendship. i thought there’s a difference between politely responding to someone out of obligation and what felt to me like further initiation of contact and I thought they made this choice based on what they wanted, but it makes me sad that harassment is so common that people feel like they have to respond a certain way to avoid backlash. \n",

I really should just buy my own toilet paper but I'm too much of a cheap fuck to do that. So instead I deal with some really bloody poop-wiping seshs. \n",

He messed up all my progress when we spent an entire day together, filled with teasing and laughter. It ended with a hug... confessed how it made me feel, thinking something would have happened and got nothing. He just gave me a recap of the day. It is a constant on and off communication, with a constant dismal of everything that has happened. There has been no comment on whether or not he is interested in me in a different manner that isn't a friend. I'm over the idea that something will happen and the possibility of dating, BUT I don't connect with people often much less even want to have sex with someone. Do I put myself out there yet again for the 3rd time or call it quits and finally accept nothing will ever happen. \n",

I hate myself. I'm the lowest scum of this earth and it's all my fault. I don't want to be a cheater. This isn't me. I always tried my best to be the best man I could, but now this happened and there's no going back.

I didn’t even realize I was gay at the time, but this year I finally started coming to terms with it and I officially came out. That girl and I are now friends, and although I know we’re not compatible, and I’m not ready to date yet because I’m still figuring myself out, ever since I came out, I get so nervous about everything I say to her and wonder if she’ll figure out I liked her and find it really creepy. She gets hit on by men all the time and she’s confided in me about that, and I just want to be respectful and friendly but I’m so scared that thinks that I’m just like all those predatory guys. I keep overanalyzing all the texts I sent her and wondering if they came off as flirty and weird and hating myself. It doesn’t help that she calls me beautiful/gorgeous/cute and sends me heart emojis and used to keep an ongoing text thread with me for several weeks (at first I thought she felt the same way but then I realized a lot of girls do this all the time - I’m shy and socially anxious so I didn’t realize this before). I don’t want to have feelings and I just want to be normal and keep the friendship, and I really regret coming out because it’s made me feel so anxious and lonely all the time- I think I should have waited until I could get over the internalized homophobia more. I really hope she doesn’t hate me. \n",

My relationship with my ex has probably been the happiest I have been in my entire life, and it shows in the photos of that year I look healthier, more motivated, got better grades, my smile is bigger. We never fought and he's still one of the best sources of support in my life, he's the least stereotypical ex that you might hear of. I don't know if I should still dump my long distance bf, not knowing if my ex and I will ever go back (probably not) or give my bf the chance he's asking for and use the help he's offering to get over these feelings.

It was kind of awkward, and I'd chalk it to myself because breaking ice is something I'd rather avoid but everything was fine. A bit later into the party we'd hang out and talk to other people, and I get this weird vibe from this dude, some sort of social ineptness?

Later on when the host of the party started to announce some sort of ice-breaker game (think like talking to other people across the table from you in the dining area about your favorite etc etc), and this dude finds me again and decides to sit next to me. Well at least since he's beside me I'm not really going to talk to him, right? As it turns out I had to listen to his conversation because the other side of the long table rotates while our side stayed put, and in every conversation he'd make some sort of awkwardly self-deprecating remark and weave in some niche jokes he has and I'd just watch the other person smile awkwardly too.

      "\n",
      "Working for HDH is legitimately hell. All places are always understaffed, so you can have the same students opening at 6:30am or closing at 11:30pm/1:30am three to four times a week -sometimes even both in one day (it adds up). Student workers are slammed almost every shift because we are regularly scheduled shortstaffed. \n",
      "\n",
      "All the promises HDH says is a lie. They are not flexible at all. Sure, they will schedule you during your free hours but have fun working till 1:30am when you have an 8am the next day or working from 6:30am till 9:30am when you have a class at 10am. You only get to call off twice a quarter. If you get sick last minute but have already called off twice, you're shit out of luck and have to go in anyways unless you can get last minute coverage (and you still have to bring in a doctors note). Also, no student worker is allowed to call off work during finals week. \n",
      "\n",
      "Sometimes the milk that we use to make coffee is past its expiration date. There is no quality check for any food. I've seen moldy food, food with flies, etc, put on the shelf. Unless the vegetables/fruits are visibly rotting on the outside, we do not clear them out. They literally stay there until someone buys it or it rots completely. If you buy bad food, bring it back and they will refund you. Highkey I would never eat at Pines again (understaffed + high traffic = corners are being cut somewhere)\n",
      "\n",
      "The careers, the people that work full time, create a really toxic work environment for the new hires. If any of the newbies make a mistake they'll rip them a new one. Newbies also receive like no formal training and they are just bossed around like they should already know everything.  \n",

It also makes it more painful because he did so many things that he knew would hurt me because I loved him. And even though it made me furious and full of hatred for him, i still love him. It still hurts to see him have sex with other people, and it hurts when he asks for my opinion on men he wants to fuck. Anyway I’m tired of being defined as someone who is hung up on some asshole so I guess posting this is a cathartic moment for me. Lol but it also happens to be my 4th cathartic moment so maybe I’ll never learn. What’s your recommendation for unrequited love?\n",

I poured too much attention onto her instead of myself that I've become attached to her and became emotionally wrecked that my efforts have not been compensated. It is hurting both of us, we both want this problem to go away. She hoped for me to stop liking her so we stay as good friends and I want to know if my efforts meant anything. Self-help articles suggested cutting the connection altogether but we don't agree. So I formed a plan where I pay less attention to her and focus on myself, rebuild my self-respect, and able to voice my disagreements against her again. When the time comes, we become normal friends. Any advice or dangers that I should be aware of during this plan? ps: she's dating someone now and I feel extremely uncomfortable\n",

It's frustrating and hard to see people like that thrive while you're thrown down.

She calls them ugly and rate them to get a reaction from our friends and it’s so annoying to see her put down other women. I can see her insecurity shining through and it’s sad how she has to do that for attention and societal gain. She should focus on her own problems instead of giving her bullshit opinion that no one asked for about other girls’ looks. Like do you literally have nothing nice to say but say “she’s ugly” every time someone says a girl is pretty? I usually don’t hate women, but this one girl is pushing the limit. I don’t understand how she has so many guys whipped as well, even though they know how shitty of a person she is. \n",

As someone who is 420 friendly, I lit a joint just to make friends and to calm my nerves down. After a few minutes of smoking someone tell us that were not suppose to smoke in this area but someone said it was 420 friendly at the place. So I thought it was the spot I was smoking in, so I move a few feet from where I was, not knowing where I was suppose to smoke. After smoking with a few people, I was feeling good cause I thought I was making friends. But my paranoid ass kept thinking about what that person said because I was trying to follow the rules and make sure Im not crossing any boundaries. So for the rest of the night I felt like everyone was starring at me because I lit a joint in the wrong area and now everyone knows who I am because of my mistake. Like I feel really bad because I know the feeling of having a rando smoke in the wrong area. I am really hoping this does not effect the first impressions of when people meet me. I really meant no harm. My lowkey crossed ass even went to the person and said sorry for smoking and she said it was fine but idk if it is. Sorry if this is long, but this has me really thinking because I don't want people to see me in the wrong way. But let me know how you would have felt if someone was smoking weed in the wrong area. Would you not invite them to future parties? Will you gossip this with everyone and let them know that I broke the rules?\n",

I have asked her multiple times to clean up after herself and try to be more considerate of the common spaces, and she says she will, but she never does. I sometimes clean up after her mess because I need to use the kitchen and dining room too, but I shouldn't have to. She never leaves the apartment either (which I know she has a right to be in, but at this point it's just suffocating) and she just plays games on her laptop all the time while blasting YouTube videos. So clearly she has the time to clean up after herself, but she's fucking lazy. I don't know what else I can do considering I do say something and have asked her to be more conscious. \n",

So your definition allows it so that the exact same actions discriminating the exact same ethnicity can be done in one country and not be racist, but then can be done in another country and be hella racist. And we don't have to stop there. You honestly think that white people are the majority in Mexico, or Africa? and do you honestly believe that people in Mexico and Africa are not as hostile if not more hostile to white people than you guys who believe in this double standard racism are?

      "7354 Response involving @7543 and @7609\n",
      "Since there’s been at least two questions regarding it, I wanted to throw my two cents on the whole fat girl issue and then explain. \n",
      "\n",
      "First of all, I am a guy who prefers fat girls. Yes we do exist, and we’re probably not what you think we are.\n",
      "\n",
      "Off the bat, I need to say that, at least in my case, this preference isn’t something definite to mean that any girl who is fat is immediately sexy. In my life, I have been attracted to thinner girls as well-it’s just that I tend to find the softness and curves of a bigger girl sexier. I also need to explain that there is not just one kind of fat girl. For some reason, idiotic people like @7543 will just group anyone with more body fat than average together as just “fat people”. At least for me, a fat admirer (Usually known online as a FA), this is beyond narrow-minded. Women, fat or skinny, come in so many different shapes and sizes and everyone has different preferences for the ideal distribution of (Or lack of) fat is. What I’m trying to say is that just because people like me say we like fat girls doesn’t mean than anyone with a big belly (Don’t call it fupa. It makes you sound even more like an asshole btw), or a phat booty will be attractive to an FA; it can help, but it isn’t the end all. At least in my case, I personally think that facial features and height are of greater priority when determining how physically attractive a girl is than just how fat they are. However, this isn’t the case for all those who are prefer fat people which leads me to my next point.\n",
      "\n",
      "The reason that FAs like myself are so afraid to proverbially, “come out of the closet” is because of the enormous stigmas around our preference. And this is mostly due in part to the associations that FAs have with fat fetishism. If I would even mention that I liked fat girls to my guy friends, they would immediately not only make fun of me, but think that I was only into really big girls. The stigma is never thought of as that you like thicc girls, or girls with a few extra pounds-you must like morbidly obese girls or girls whose weight is detrimental to their health. Therefore, you are a sicko and gross. In terms of girls, if an FA were to tell them that they thought they were hot or that they liked larger women, they would run-simple as that. That’s because most big girls know about the small percentage of “feeders” out there who gain sexual pleasure from their girl grotesquely gaining weight. And I don’t mean to fetish shame, but most girls should be scared-that’s crazy unhealthy and wrong. Because of these really strong associations with very, very negative sexual appetites, people who just like fat girls the way they are risk a whole lot when coming out. And when coupled with the whole “you must like all fat people” stigmatism I talked about earlier, it makes it tough to just come out and tell people “I’m a guy who like fat girls” like @7609 requests. Part of me wanted to make this whole soapbox speech public but I knew I couldn’t. Maybe someday, but not now.\n",
      "\n",
      "So in the end I want to tell fat girls that there are good guys who will love you and your curves for all eternity. It’s a rough community I’m not going to lie-but just know that you can be loved and thought of as beautiful just as anyone else can be : )\n",

      "\n",
      "They're basically an unofficial fraternity, except worse in a lot of ways. The worst part is that they refuse to acknowledge or admit that anything's wrong. Despite being an organization for video games, I've never seen a higher concentration of ravers and drug abusers in one place. I've seen innocent young freshman turn into cocaine addicts directly due to being part of the club. In most organizations, you can just say \"I want to join\" and become part of the fun, but really the only way to \"join\" Triton Gaming is to interview to become an officer —which is essentially rushing a frat, with a recruitment period, initiation and hazing included. Otherwise, it's a cliquey mess that'll remind you of those high school dramas on TV. The amount of gossip and rumors that get passed around is absolutely mind boggling. The closest thing to being a general member you can get is by paying them for a piece of plastic with a logo so you can get imaginary points at their events. And even if you just try hanging out with the members like a regular person, they'll shit talk the people behind their backs, making every effort to exclude them until they stop showing up.\n",
      "\n",
      "And you'd think that a gaming organization would be overwhelmingly male, since that's the primary demographic for gamers. But the org will basically take in any cute girl, turning into a pathetic hunting ground for their attention. Good luck getting in if you're a male who isn't already friends with someone inside. They stalk female applicants social media as an unofficial part of their application process, commenting on how they look as if they're grocery shopping. Some of the female members don't even play games, in an exclusive gaming club. Guys will pick up girls as littles just to get a chance to sleep with them, and no one seems to have a problem with that. Their \"families\" are just an incestuous dating platform. \n",
      "\n",
      "Even structurally, they're just a monopoly of several orgs, breaking the rules that other orgs have to follow left and right. They have a separate organization for each game, but really that's just so they can book more rooms and get an office to themselves. They've figured out the funding system to a T, taking campus money that's meant to give money to support events, but instead they use the money to buy lunch and dinner for the officers. Half their organizations don't hold a general meeting like they're supposed to every quarter, and don't even do anything besides support the main organization. The confusing part is that if you join one of their \"orgs\" but not the main one, they won't even really consider you part of the org unless you've specifically joined Triton Gaming. \n",
      "\n",
      "The coolest part of Triton Gaming is probably all their sponsorships, which provides them with a lot of the prizing. But for a lot of the good prizing, they'll just host a \"tournament\" and have their competitive team players sweep the competition to get thousands of dollars of prizing for themselves. And even if you do manage to win prizing, there are a ton of people who never get their prizing for some reason or another.\n",
      "\n",
      "The worst part is that everyone in the org knows that it's all at least somewhat true, but they're all too stuck on their high horses to realize it. \n",

I’ve been on a couple dates and they always go horribly because I’m too shy and awkward and of course they don’t ask for a second date :-(It really sucks because I’ve always wanted a boyfriend and I feel like no one is capable of liking me at this point and I feel super lonely.

      "7378 After reading many confessions about being incompetent, I feel the need to say something. It sucks but humans are judgmental by nature. The moment we see someone, we immediately, and unconsciously, form opinions about whether we like them or not. On pages like Subtle Asian Dating, or even UCSD class of xxxx pages, you see two types of posts: those with 500 likes and 100 comments, and those with 5 likes. This is why everyone tries to \"fit in\" to the stereotypical things that everyone seems to have in common. \n",

I honestly have no idea what I’m doing in my major and how I can continue and further my future career. But to me that’s not even the saddest part. I still can’t confidently say I have a single friend at this school. Honestly I try to be super open and sociable but it never works. I’ve tried a few orgs at this point but I haven’t found anything that really sticks with me. They’re fine but it never feels right and I don’t actually feel like I’m making friends or any connections. I mean nobody even remembers me. And I still have no game with girls, I try to be that perfect guy that girls want but I always fuck it up somehow. I can have one amazing day with a girl and the next day it’s like nothing ever happened. I’m so tired of living that I wished it could all just end at some point but honestly I’m too much of a pussy to actually do it. So I’ll hang around here for a bit longer until I really think it’s time. I’ve been through this before but this is the first time I’ve tried so hard to actually make friends and be that person that everyone likes and adores. I feel I’ve done many things to make myself better like putting myself out there but it’s just not working for me. The only thing that keeps me going is that maybe if I keep living and trying I’ll find what I’m looking for eventually. I’m not looking for a therapist or people to pity me. I want my life to get better, but I just don’t know how that’s gonna happen. I guess it’s finally time to become a fuckboi/gangster. But seriously if you actually read this whole thing you’re a real one. Cuz only real people put up and listen to messed up trash like me.\n",

I always placed career satisfaction above pay because I think that, if I reallly love my job, I'll find a way to make a lot of money out of it regardless of what it is. Now I've fallen in love with Archeology after taking Professor Collazo's class and I love every single aspect of it and I seem to be genuinely good at it. I can really seem myself in this career. But now I'm feeling really conflicted as Archeology does not let me help people like Neuroscience or med does. That's the only reason I like those subjects as I never really enjoyed all the math that goes into it. I just want to see what you guys think of Archeology as major, as there seems to be very few of us here\n",

Its pretty easy for me to put myself in others' shoes and understand why they chose to do things a certain way. However, I'm not sure if I like this trait of mine. Because of this, I allow people back into my life pretty easily. If you have earned my trust once, you can do a lot of things and I would probably end up forgiving you. If you had my trust at some point, you could shatter me in a million pieces and I'd still welcome you back with open arms. Hesitantly yes, but I can't bring myself to leave/ghost people. I feel extremely guilty doing so. I also overthink hella and that doesn't help in the slightest. Sometimes I feel like people avoid me/are tired of me and it really kills me inside. Granted, I'm probably suffocating them cuz I don't have many friends here and only stick with a group of people, but I really don't know what to do.

They are weak, and because of it they strive for something they believe that makes them unique, more purposeful than their peers and counter parts (the jocks/chads) intelligence.

Of course, most girls are not into them because of several different reasons, and decline. First impressions usually leave a lasting impression. They cope, and this is where some of the culture splits, some thinking that the issue is not with them because it's impossible in their minds (I mean if you're the most intelligent being on this planet, who wouldn't love you). For incels, they think it's because of their physical appearance. For nice guys, they think its because girls like assholes or something similar to that aspect.

Lately, I find myself crying over the littlest things. I’ll see something that reminds me of him and I’ll cry. I’m trying to figure this out and i want to fix this.... I think. I’m honestly really not sure. I kinda deserve this since I got myself into this mess but I’m at a point where I think I’ll lose two of the most important people in my life that I met from UCSD. If you’re reading this, please know that I love and care a lot about you two. Because of how complicated things got recently, I’ve considered just sacrificing our relationship... but I can’t do it. It hurts my heart so much to lose you two. Why can’t things be easier? Why can’t things go back to the way they were?

      "Just ended things with my boyfriend and best friend. He was my first and what we had was wildly special and rare. But I thought I’d share our year long escapade on campus. You can try to guess what college we’re in, but there’s not a college on campus we don’t have a story in. Baby I know you will see this, and I hope at least one of these makes you laugh or smile. So here it goes:\n",
      "\n",
      "The first night we hung out, I was crazy enough to say I’d go out with you. Our first week of dating consisted of us talking all night and listening to music, that we would end up both sleeping in the dorm lounge (I had never met anyone with a relatively similar music taste to mine until you). In fact, 3 of the first 4 days we were together you stayed the night. The other night, you stroked my hair until I fell asleep in the lounge and covered me with a sweater. That was only after knowing you for less than 48 hours (I should’ve thought you were a creep and ran away). A week later, the resident advisors said to not have friends sleep over in the common area, I tried so hard to hold in my laughter at this meeting because I knew they were referring to us, but we never got caught because no one had known who we were yet. \n",
      "\n",
      "We later convinced someone to let us into the village study room that first weekend together, and ended up sleeping there all night. We even shared our first kiss there. You thought you could wait to take me to Fallen Star that Tuesday to kiss me, but you just couldn’t wait. Remember how cold it was and I was a freshie who couldn’t find a bathroom, so I ran across the street and peed in a bush? I had quite the courage back then; and you were still into me even after that. To the guys who found us there in the morning and congratulated my bf, nothing happened. That day was both our first walk of shame. \n",
      "\n",
      "That week we also looked at the stars from Marshall field…until the sprinklers went off on us and I thought we were in a movie. (Although this also happened to us on the old fields by AP&M.) We moved to the side where there was no sprinklers, and the security guard just stared at us. I was so self conscious, but you had a way to calm me down and make me laugh. (I’m thankful to all the security this year who let us be.) \n",
      "\n",
      "After just a few weeks together, on Thursday night, we took a sleeping bag and slept in it together on RIMAC field. (So to the guy who asks if he can take a walk outside at 3am and to the other OP who asks if they can walk on RIMAC field here is your answer.) We set an alarm to get out of there early, thinking we wouldn’t be seen, but instead got woken up by maintenance mowing the lawn. That was the day I learned you sleep like a log. I was so embarrassed and scrambled to get out of the cold wet field. What freaks we probably looked like carrying a sleeping bag across campus. \n",
      "\n",
      "I didn’t know how much I loved the thrill of sneaking around until I met you. Let me remind you of a few of my favorite memories, that probably got all jumbled into a blur with the rest of our year.\n",

      "Something we tend to forget, is when we made out on the Muir field triton emblem, just hours before the school wide fire drill. We probably only got 2 hours of sleep before that fire alarm went off. \n",
      "\n",
      "We also made out in our department’s conference room and stairwells. (I’m glad we never got caught and decided to divide business and pleasure.)

      "I remember we went to the woods one night and you were terrified. This night was the first time things got really spicy. I think you tripped over a branch while you tried to take off my shirt. I’ve never seen you scramble so fast for your clothes like when that group of people went down there to smoke. I’m pretty sure you put your shirt on inside-out.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also remember very early in the year when you took me to 6th floor of Geisel to study and I swore never to come back because I hated the silence. I had tried to avoid Geisel, and you gave me more reason to. You left me with your stupid Altoids box while you tried to find better WiFi connection. Dumbly I went searching for you with the mint box jingling as I walked the entire floor. Little did we know later that summer we’d be in one of those study rooms making out, without a care in the world. \n",

      "Years down the road, I’ll still remember when we snuck into the Marshall Sequoyah discussion rooms after hours and talked about family and life. We were probably there longer than all the times I went there for my math discussion that quarter.\n",

      "I wanted to reach every rooftop and view on campus by the end of the school year, and baby I bet we did. We watched the sunset from the top floor of Rady. We talked many times on the trail in Warren behind CV with our hands intertwined, overlooking the canyon. As well as shared many kisses on those steps. (This was my happy place on days I could not see you.) We later found out about the rooftop on HSS & AP&M (not an original spot) but this became a regular for us, and was still a thrill. \n",
      "\n",
      "But not as much of a rush as the night we went to the PC balcony. What a view that was when we sat on your blanket and looked at the moon. We stayed there way past closing time and were locked inside PC. I was clutching your hand so tightly as I whispered, “We’re gonna get caught. They’re gonna have us on video, or there’s a silent alarm”, as we walked out. (A few weeks later they locked the balcony, and I wondered if it was because of us.) \n",
      "\n",
      "My favorite day of the week was Friday, not necessarily because it was the end of the school week, but because of Friday night dinners and ice cream with you. On the weekends we would spend all day focused on a couch doing schoolwork, not talking just exchanging music every now and then, because after we would relax and watch movies together. Weekends were the best, because you were the last thing I fell asleep to and the first person I woke up to. I’m gonna miss your arms holding me under the layers of blankets, and being lazy with you. \n",
      "\n",
      "I’ll miss getting Goody’s and eating lunch at the hammocks in the sunshine. I’m never gonna forget that day we ditched school to walk down to the beach. To the summertime lunches on top of the Revelle Keeling apartments. I still vividly remember watching the sunset together on the 4th of July there. When a group of summer program students came by we snuck to the 7th floor and watched it there instead. I snapped a few pictures of you looking out at the sunset shortly before you swept your hands on to my hips and we stood and watched the colors dance across the sky.\n",
      "\n",
      "We used to go on walks through ERC and stop on the rooftop of Cafe V looking down in the business of life inside. We also laid on the grass outside, nearby the laundry rooms, and that was the first place you told me about your ex. I hope I don’t become a story like her one day. \n",
      "\n",
      "When you would take me home, I used to make you take me the long way so I could see the neon word lights at Powell. We spent so many nights outside shivering and exploring campus. I feel sorry for the countless Triton Rides we had to call, when it got too late and we were just a little too delirious. \n",
      "Wandering around with you was the best. My favorite adventure was when we visited Fallen Star in the summer. I was in love with how excited and amazed you were as you smiled down at the view. What I would give to go back in time to that moment. Or any of these moments. I’m gonna love you for a while baby. I hope that’s okay.\n",

Although I now know my worth, I continue to date douchey men that are not good for me. I think it’s a mechanism of self-protection because I don’t build expectations of the relationship and then and therefore cannot be disappointed. I also think I’m fearful of being vulnerable and I’m worried that I’m incapable of abandoning this unhealthy behavior. When nice men express interest, I become cold to ward them off and later I slightly regret pushing them away, but that regret doesn’t compare to the heartbreak I’ve experienced in the past so I continue doing it.

However, the one thing I do hate is clicking super well with customers because I know that it'll likely be the first and only time I'll see them, making it impossible for me to have real connections outside my suite, and I really want to be friends with y'all but it's so hard, so if you don't have friends (or want to make new ones), don't be afraid to ask to hang out with an HDH worker because chances are, we are dead inside serving processed food and need cool peeps to hang out with.

I got to know her so intimately and genuinely thought she was interested in me romantically too because she even asked about my past sexual history.  We would send memes and flirty texts to each other but after I met her in person once over summer she began to talk to me less and less.  I'm trying to move on but also I met her friend who goes here (UCSD) and became lecture buddies with her.  It's sad because everytime I have lecture with her friend, I have to be reminded of how I never shot my shot.  I still have contact with her but I feel like the window of opportunity is shrinking if it even exists.  I think getting ghosted would her less because at least it would give me a sense of closure.  I can't even clarify now because that will make things iffy between me and her friend.  Like even though we were never officially a \"thing\" it hurts. I know it's my fault for catching feelings but dammit it still hurts because I don't know if I was a summer fling or if she got bored or what.  You feel me or nah?  \n",

At first I was kinda mad because it made me feel like he was judging me to be a super conservative person just because I'm white, but then I realized how sad it is that people of my race tend to even think this way to begin this way and that people who are LGBT+ have to feel that way around us.

I mean, it's just stupid now-I've always been a healthy and reasonably active person who eats well and exercises. But my girlfriend (We've been together ~3 years) as of the past year has just been taking health and fitness to a whole new level. Everything I eat that's not dry kale or cauliflower is scrutinized and she never wants to go try new places to eat with me unless they're those healthy ones. I mean I like that kinda food too, but it gets old after going to the same ones every week. And then she always passively makes me feel like shit for craving an \"unhealthy food item\" like pizza. We haven't eaten pizza in 2 months and even then, it was cauliflower-crust! In addition to that bs, she's always at the gym-which is fine as I go there too (Not at the same time usually though due to scheduling) but as you can probably figure out, it's ALL the time now. She'll go multiple times a day sometimes so I barely even get to see her. When I ask if she's trying to avoid being around me or would like to take a break, she claims that she still loves me. And when we're together we do occasionally have good fun (And good sex). But tbh,  I think she's more in love with her bony-ass body since she never seems to walk-the-walk in wanting to spend time with me and especially want to enjoy life with me. It's just such a shame since I love her so much and we have so much history. But whenever I try to ask for a compromise and say she should cool it with the fitness shit, she loses her mind and gets all defensive ending in an argument that I always end up losing. I think I'm done but it's going to be a rough winter for me  : ( \n",

My bf is not a bad person, but he has made mistakes in the past which stuck with me and I can't seem to get over. He's been really jealous and controlling and would always want to know where I was or look at my snap map multiple times. I always put up with him but I did speak up and told him it bothered me. He's gotten upset at me multiple times for stupid stuff, but when I came to college it just went past what I could manage. I was with my mum, spending time with her as I would not be able to see her for a month until her next visit (I'm an international student and the flight is 9+ hours away). I told him I was currently with her (as I always tell him what I'm currently doing so he knows if I'm busy or not) and a few minutes later he got upset that I was only replying to him on one social media and not on the others where he had left messages as well (sent me memes on instagram dms, snaps as well but I was just replying through text). We would constantly fight about stuff like this that I consider so immature, but this time it really triggered me because it involved my mum. Whenever I talk to him about how the stuff that he does upsets me he does apologise sincerely and honestly, and his usual lines are \"I'm sorry babe, I promise I will get better for you, please don't lose faith in me\". To be honest he has gotten better and even though there's some things that still bother me, I have no complaints at the moment. Thing is, I find myself getting more irritated over every little thing, or if he asks something like \"Who's that guy in your story\" in the most transparent way I will get really defensive and assume he's jealous again. I know this is not right and I have been trying to work on myself and make things work out because he is a great guy and he knows how to grow as a person, but I don't know if I can get much more broken than what I already am. He's in a different continent too, and always says \"i'm coming mid [insert month]\" but he never does. I know this is none of my business because planning a trip is expensive, however I was clear enough with him from the beginning that I wouldn't be able to see him until my summer holidays 2019 and he's made me think he was coming to see me every month starting with july and cancelling last minute. I don't know how much longer I can wait, I haven't seen him since January last year, and I feel if I saw him face to face maybe all our issues could get solved (I've always believed face to face contact is the most sincere it can get) but its been 23 months already. And my biggest problem is every time I try to tell him I need a break from the relationship I'll tear down before I say it. I don't know what to do.\n",

      "7913 Being super liberal does not make you woke. Just because your morals are different does not mean you have a moral high ground. Just because people have different opinions or beliefs does not make them stupid. That goes both ways. Looking at both liberals and conservatives here. Things like that create partisanship. Just because someones a republican doesnt mean theyre racist. But also just because you say youre not racist, doesnt mean you arent. Just because you think what you believe in is right, doesnt entitle you to ridicule others for not thinking that way. If a Christian doesnt agree with abortion and thinks its murder, you cant be like \"How the fuck can you be so stupid its not murder and its not youre baby,\" you have to realize theres fundamental differences that make them think the way they do, and that has to entirely with the fact that in their bible its what they believe to be murder and it is in their moral responsibility to try and vote against it. The same way you have to respect the religious beliefs of every other major religion, you have to see where theyre coming from. Now Christians, you can't denigrate people for not believing in God  and not believing in the Bible, because just because you believe it doesnt mean that everyone else has to as well. If none of this applies to you, disregard. This is coming from a democrat. Moral of the story, just dont be an asshole. \n",

Because our dynamic was very one-sided initially, I often get insecure that he's still looking at/talking to other girls. There are other reasons why, but it's too specific to my situation to confess. We've talked about it and he reassured me that he's not, and knowing how he is he probably isn't. Also, this is stalkery but there's this one girl I noticed he follows that's super pretty and dresses well and seems like she has a really cool personality. My intuition is she was a Tinder match for various reasons. Recently I quickly glanced at his phone as my eyes were wandering, and he was looking through his instagram dms and her icon was there near the middle/top and one of them sent a heart. Ok this is pretty stupid it was a split second and I'm overthinking probably, but is it ok for me to be so anxious about her? I can't tell if it's just because it's my first relationship and I'm just being insecure. I know I should stop checking up on her and my bf, but I can't help myself. Also, not to suck my own dick, but I'm pretty cute also a good person. I used to be ugly (lmfao) so a lot of insecurity stems from there, but I know I should be confident in myself too. I mean even I still have randoms and Tinder matches who dm me/reply to my IG stories too, but I don't have any intentions with them at all so it could be the same thing? I don't know if this is something I should just work on personally or something I should talk to him about so I can feel reassured. At the same time I don't want to tell him about her just because I don't wanna expose myself for stalking lol. I should also probably stop lurking. \n",

We can talk about whether or not a flat tax would be beneficial and things of that matter but I shouldn't need to explain that prioritizing anything over human rights and equality is inherently immoral. I just want to slap every Republican in the face with this thing called ethics because yeah, if you vote for a racist, you inherently value racial equality less than whatever personal gain you'd get, which means you don't fucking prioritize racial equality and I'd say that's racist. And if you don't want more votes counted in close races, then you're saying that people's votes aren't of equal value and that is undemocratic, might as well be a dictatorship if the government can control when to stop vote tallies for them to be in their favor. \n",

So at the end of each day when I pack up and walk to my car, I feel very lonely. My transfer process fucked many potential friends that a lot of people make at the beginning of college, and I sometimes feel like a loser butting into conversations of those who have clearly been close for a while.

The reason is that over the past few months, she's been getting abnormally close with other guys.  The thing is, the first thing I noticed is that on instagram, I see her following random guys who she doesn't even know but just goes to UCSD and like all their pictures. I didn't think much about this at first but I've realized she has been getting a lot of boys' snapchats from instagram and starting streaks with them. Then, I've seen her chatting other boys on snapchat and sending cute selfies of herself to them. I've seen her screenshot multiple snaps from other guys and even gave them different nicknames and emojis (like tongue). I've talked with her about it and she always changes the subject and simply just says \"we're just friends, don't worry about them\" which is hard for me to do given that she's so flirty with them. She also talks about her past relationships a lot too. She even went as far as comparing me with one of her exes which made me really upset and sad, that night I couldn't sleep. Maybe I'm thinking too much, but I just don't feel her true genuine affection for me and it's as if she's just keeping me around. I'm alright with her talking to other guys, but when it gets to the point of flirtation and then not being able to talk about it with me and changing the subject, I get worried. Maybe I should just leave her?\n",

      "I was born with a twin brother. He passed away when we were around 4 years old. I never asked my parents the specifics as to what had happened as I knew it was an accident and not natural. However, after work last week I drank with my mother at dinner and we had a heart to heart moment (one of those intoxicated and unfiltered ones) and my mother told me something that has been on my mind every minute since. I brought up the topic of my brother and I saw my mother's demeanor instantly shift. She looked at me and with sad eyes told me that I murdered him. She said that it seemed that I had found a way to pry open the toddler stair gate and push him down the stairs to his death.\n",
      "\n",
      "Immediately my mother began to cry and apologize for telling me, wondering why she did and I could tell she regretted it immediately, thinking I would not be able to handle the self blame.

I told her it was fine, that I was happy she told me what had happened- and that we don't need to speak of it again.\n",
      "\n",
      "The thing is, why this has been on my mind, is because I have conscious memory of my brother. Although it is distorted and the memories of a 4 year old are not to be taken as accurate- I do remember him. I remember his face and albeit our young age, a 4 year old does have significant cognition. I do not remember killing him though. I do not even remember the grief my parents had when finding his body. I only remember a few of the days following.\n",
      "\n",
      "What is keeping me up at night is that I do not feel self blame or grief, learning that I am responsible for his death. My friends tell me I shouldn't as I was young and naturally irresponsible. However I disagree. I am sure, although I have no recollection, that it was a conscious decision in the moment. Those toddler staircase gates are not easy to open nor is it easy to push a toddler (as a toddler yourself) down a flight of stairs. Furthermore, I am concerned because I feel nothing. No guilt, no sadness, but I feel a strange combination of relief and fear. I am relieved of the questions surrounding what happened to him but now I am fearful of losing control again- should the circumstance arise. \n",

They tell me I don't make girls feel insecure in order to make them like them. They tell me I actually care unlike most guys. They tell me I possess all the qualities of a perfect boyfriend. I want to love and I feel ready, but no one has ever given me a chance. It has been friendzone after friendzone after friendzone. Whenever I see couples on campus, I get this feeling of optimism while at the same time emptiness. I'm losing hope. Maybe my friends have been lying to me\n",

      "I recently came to the conclusion that I don't trust my boyfriend. Why? I've noticed some things these past 2 months. 1. Whenever he's on snapchat, he'll show me the snaps that he gets from his guy friends. However, he won't open the ones that he gets from females in front of me. One of these females even has a purple heart by her name, which I know was not already preset. 2. He follows and likes images of all these nude or provocative women on instagram to the point where his whole feed is just nudes.This carries on to snapchat too. It's often enough that these women start becoming his ads (the creepy thing google does by showing you what you look at often).  I actually would not be very concerned about this because it's a normal guy thing, as with watching porn (he does do this as well). The thing about this that does not sit well is that he tries to hide it from me and the fact that he finds it harder to finish during intercourse now because of all the masturbating he does. 3. He talks about his exes a lot. He still has pictures of him and his exes saved, like one of those post shower pics. Am I just being over analytical about everything? I've been trying to not let it get to me this past month, but it drives me absolutely insane. I feel like the best course of action for me is to end the relationship.\n",

      "8081 I know Stan Lee just died a couple of days ago and I don't want to talk ill about him but he was given too much credit for what he actually did. Many people think that he was the only creator of a lot of super heroes but that's not true. The silver age of comics in Marvel was created mainly by three people, these being Stan Lee, Jack Kirby, and Steve Ditko. Lee wasn't the sole creator, he didn't think of every idea and every concept by himself. There were more people into that. And I think it sucks that people don't even know who Jack Kirby or Steve Ditko were. For example I saw some photos as tribute towards Stan Lee and one had Thanos in it and Stan Lee didn't even created Thanos, Jim Starlin did. Another one is the last scene of Toy Story 3 where Andy gives the toys to the little girl but instead it was Stan Lee with Kevin Feige. Half of the characters that Stan Lee hands down to Kevin weren't even created by him such as Captain America, Scott Lang, Bucky, Thor and all of the new iteration of the Gotg except for Groot. \n",

They felt that \"we\" couldn't take care of him and he wouldn't be okay after his older puppy brother passed away a month ago, but I can't help but think that they just didn't want the responsibility. He was a rescue from the Thai meat trade so he was testy, but my roommate still constantly tried to hold and squeeze him when he was clearly uncomfortable and got mad at him for thrashing around trying to get away from them. I was much closer with him, he would come cuddle and sleep with me every night and I honestly think my roommate hated that. He was never my dog, and I had no right to do anything to keep him, but they never even asked me to help out with him and then said \"we\" couldn't handle it. He's probably happier with his foster family, which makes me feel better, but I'm pissed because I would have given him the world if I got any say. I miss you Eko 😭❤\n",

I was out of school for a whole week and the school district was scared that the schools were going to burn down. SDGE got into hella hot water because an investigation was done and it turns out that they weren’t really taking care of the power lines. Now I feel like SDGE is overcompensating and trying to make themselves look better. My siblings don’t have school tomorrow because SDGE shut off the power to some of the county.

I know last year there was a fire really close to my house and my dad was chilling at home (he was worried about looters + wanted to defend the house). SDGE left the power on. Like why do this now when there’s no fire but leave it on when there is a fire. I guess the other thing that bothers me is that this kind of shows that SDGE can turn off the power whenever they feel like it and there’s not really anything we can do about it.

Like I replied his snap as soon as I got his snap. But it takes him forever. Also I’m tired of waiting. So now I’m so pettty that I count how many hours I wait for his snap, then I postpone those many hours to open his snap.  I also notice that he watched all my snap story but doesn’t open my snaps which is confusing. He never leave me on read though. Any opinion ? Is that a hint that I should stop annoying him ? Also if you’re one of those people that I described, please make it clear that you re not interested in someone if you re not interested.\n",

I just can't get over the embarrassment, like how the hell am I going to tell my professors this? I haven't even brought myself to tell my doctors this, I don't think I'd be able to look anyone in the eye after saying it.

      "8180 So here goes a confession... I’ve known for a long time that I have depression/anxiety, but lately it’s been worse than ever. I gain/lose weight constantly, either sleep too much/too little, can’t focus, and I just generally feel worn out all the time. I joined a sport this year because I’m athletic and missed being competitive on a team but I just don’t enjoy it anymore and I feel more stressed about acting like I still enjoy it. Ive been to therapy in the past; it helped get past some anxious situations, but overall I still felt the same. I’m leaning toward wanting medication or something but the thought of asking a doctor for that is so overwhelming I don’t know where to start or like if I even need it. Recently I changed my doctor to get help for some stomach issues (ulcers), and the new doctor asked if I had a history with these problems and I actually said yes. I’m going in for a follow up soon and I really want to articulate how I really feel, but when I’m in those types of situations (even in therapy) where I have to describe out loud what I struggle with I get so stuck and compensate for my problems. My parents tell me to get over the stuff I’ve hinted at to them because it’s just me vs my mind but I’m at an end where I’m just so exhausted and overwhelmed and not myself anymore that it’s hard to get over it by just thinking through it like I might have been able to do in the past. A lot of people here probably think I’m a very awkward&shy girl but really I can be very outgoing, it’s just I’m so exhausted with going through the motions and dealing with increasing stress that I just shut down. \n",

She didn't even tell me she was sorry or like can we do it another day, her responses were really cold. It just seems as she didn't care. That day I cried and felt lost and started blaming myself for our friendship. After since, I decided I didn't want to be friends with her anymore but today I went for a walk I saw her and it was really awkward. I started feeling those bad feelings that I once had when I saw her. I started asking myself was it my fault for the lost of our friendship? I feel lonely and sad because she was such a dear and close friend of mine. I just don't know what to do anymore. I am scared of making new friends.\n",
