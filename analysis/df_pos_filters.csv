14358,2019-09-07 16:32:43,"Sorry about the word vomit just working through some shit.  

I might be in love with someone, or almost in love at any rate. I think it might also just be a hunger to have someone that I could love and be loved by. It‚Äôs an ache, but also almost comforting. I got a little taste of what it could have been if things had gone differently, and that certainly intensified things. And I know I could still maybe take that path, but it wouldn‚Äôt be right. You can‚Äôt make other people love you when you know that you can‚Äôt give them what they really need. I‚Äôm a fucking mess, after all. Closeted, tired, anxious, ill, afraid.  

Additionally, I don‚Äôt want to be a consolation prize, and deep down, with that particular person, it would always be that way in my own eyes. Essentially, I‚Äôm only a placeholder, a poor substitute, a seemingly nearby convenience‚Äì even though being in their arms felt so right, it would be so very wrong because I wouldn‚Äôt be what she really wants in the first place. She once said a long time ago that she had thought she liked me, but then realized it was just proximity. If they had wanted me, it would have happened by now. Besides, I don‚Äôt want to stick around my hometown. I need to move on and out, or else I‚Äôll just suffocate willingly in my own dead air.  

And yet if she ever calls, I‚Äôm there. I know I would do anything in my power for her. I am loyal to those I care about, basically to a fault. For someone who wants to escape life, I almost always stick around. 

Then again, I‚Äôm human. And that means wanting disparate and entirely non-simultaneous things, the existence of the cake in conjunction with its absence. I love her. But I also don‚Äôt. I want her to love me back, but I also want nothing to do with that aspect of our relationship whatsoever. I want to stay close by, but I also want to be as far away as possible from the life I have lived for the past twenty years. I don‚Äôt want to be me anymore, whatever that means. I don‚Äôt want to be the person she knows anymore, and I will never probably be the person she thinks I am, although she‚Äôs probably closer to the truth than anyone else is. 

It is reminiscent of how I feel when I want to kill myself. I want to die, to escape, to be free, to feel nothing ever again, to feel everything at once and then let it go. I also want to live‚Äì so I can escape, and feel positive things, and be free, free, free and actually enjoy living my life. Hard to enjoy freedom when dead. It‚Äôs also hard to find love and love someone while simultaneously disavowing those emotions.  

She kind of admitted to loving me, but not exactly. She referenced queerplatonic love, a relationship that goes beyond friendship but is not romantic. I kind of admitted the same thing, but then I pretended to misunderstand‚Äì to think it just meant friendship when I know it doesn‚Äôt. But I couldn‚Äôt admit how real it is to me, and how much further I have fallen than she realizes when I know that isn‚Äôt what she wants. We agreed that we were better as friends. I honestly believe that, but I wish I didn‚Äôt. I don‚Äôt want to believe that‚Äì and I can‚Äôt fully believe it either. Disparity strikes again.  

I think she might feel something for me, perhaps more than she did in the past. She keeps me close enough, or at least the memories of me now that I have moved away. I‚Äôm the only person whose photograph is by her bedside. Her touches linger a bit more than they used to, especially after that particular conversation on what we have, what we are, what we might have been. But I‚Äôm going to close my eyes and ignore what I see, and I know she will do the same. We‚Äôre far too similar, after all.

14302,2019-05-25 01:48:53,"There's this girl who caught my eye  two years ago when we were in the same lower div physics class. She was stunning, but more importantly for me is that she seemed like someone I could relate to. I remember that Spring Quarter of 2017 that I was sitting alone in Price Center wearing my favorite band's recent tour t shirt and eating my lunch when I heard a ""Nice shirt"" directed at me; It was her walking with a friend. ""Thanks"", I replied somewhat sheepishly, and it seemed that she needed to be somewhere so that was the end of it or at least for a few weeks. Toward the end of the quarter another favorite band of mine was going to play in North Park, and it just so happened that she was also there...with her boyfriend. It never occurred to me to say anything (zero-sum thinking, I know), and I don't think she ever saw or recognized me that night, but it still wasn't the end of it. 

 I saw her again these past two quarters in upper div chemistry, but for some insane reason I did not ever say anything to her, not one word, and hell, I actually had to convince myself that it was the same girl that I saw two years ago. But now, I do think it's now the end of it. I haven't seen her in any of my classes or anywhere on campus. I think she might have graduated early, or perhaps she was a major in another department; who knows.Worst of all,  I do not even know her name at all.

A couple of weeks ago, I decided to (more-or-less permanently) leave an org I was in, the first one I had ever joined.

Back in September, I made the decision to join this org over Intergenerational Connections because it fit into my schedule (anyone reading this who is in Intergenerational Connections, let me say that I look forward to being a part of your org fall of next year). I attended their informational session and was struck by how much the org‚Äôs work aligned with my personal interests. I was also struck by how everyone made me feel so welcome and at home. They were a very charismatic and warm-hearted bunch of people. I committed myself to the org and began to attend their meetings regularly.

Before we go further, allow me to make one clarification. While, the org did have a formal hierarchical structure with a club president and her vice-presidents and director generals and so on, it was de facto led  by two people (as in they did the visible day-to-day running of the org) whom I will henceforth refer to as ‚ÄòJ‚Äô and ‚ÄòS‚Äô (for ‚ÄòJunior‚Äô and ‚ÄòSenior‚Äô; they held the same position in the org‚Äôs leadership, but one was the senior partner and one was the less-experienced junior partner), along with their associates (all of whom are VERY close friends with one another). S was away on business across the country for fall quarter but returned in January. Hence, for all of fall quarter, J ran the show alongside the org‚Äôs de jure leadership.  

My first quarter in the org were my happiest times there. We were taught the basic functions of the org and got together for some socials. My relationship with the org‚Äôs leadership was also quite positive during this time. When I injured myself and wasn‚Äôt able to attend org meetings for a couple of weeks, I emailed J telling her what had happened and she responded by saying that she totally understood and that I‚Äôm welcome back whenever I recover. A couple of weeks later, she spontaneously emailed me again checking in on my progress and to see how I was recovering. I was truly touched by the care and sincerity she showed me. After my first meeting following my recovery, I explicitly told her in person that and expressed my appreciation to her. She stated that she and S worked hard over the previous year to make the org more inclusive and less ‚Äúelitist‚Äù by interacting more with all org members, new and old. At the end-of-year social we had a week or so later, she hugged me before I left and said to me ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so glad that you‚Äôre back with all of us‚Äù. I was, again, touched by her remarks. 

Then winter quarter came and that‚Äôs when things began to go pear-shaped. S returned from her business away from UCSD and she properly introduced herself to the lot of us at the first meeting of the quarter. Then J, a couple of other new org members, and I went away to attend a work function for a couple of days. During our time away, I felt that J was becoming increasingly tense and distant around me. When we returned, I asked her (through Messenger) if something was wrong (with the intent to repair any damage there may be between us). She replied with a very lengthy text that essentially accused me of disrespecting her leadership and S (for reasons unbeknownst to me; she didn‚Äôt attend the work function with us) as well as of being sexist, without providing a shred of justification for either claim. 

I was absolutely speechless. I had no clue what she was talking about. I always ALWAYS make sure to treat everybody, irrespective of sex, with respect and dignity. I always make sure to treat my superiors with the appropriate level of respect as well. I replayed the entire time we were at the work function and could not think of one instance where I had treated her with anything less than absolute respect. I asked people close to me, people who I know would not lie to me and would give me the honest truth, if I was sexist. The result was a resounding and unanimous ‚ÄòNo‚Äô.

Being accused point-blank of such terrible things infuriated me to no end. It hurt me deeply, and I felt as if I had been betrayed. I thought about asking her to justify why she felt the way she did and trying to see if we could work it out, but then concluded that any attempt to talk to someone who‚Äôd so easily accuse another person of such horrible things would bear no fruit and that I‚Äôd just be wasting my time by trying to reason with her. Should I have attempted to talk to her? In retrospect, perhaps, but in all honesty, I didn‚Äôt feel the need or desire to have to negotiate with someone like that, nor do I now. I, and a couple of my friends, came to the conclusion that her lashing out at me as she did was the manifestation of some massive insecurity she felt as a result of struggles in her personal life (that she had detailed to us at one of our socials) as well as that outing being the first outing where she‚Äôs led the team without the help of other org leaders or the guidance of S. 

From that day on, I‚Äôve spoken less than 15 words to J. I simply refuse to even talk to people with that kind of mentality. They‚Äôre not worth my time and energy.

My experience with the org only declined from there on out. I slowly came to the realization that I couldn‚Äôt commit nearly as much time to it as they would like me to commit and consequently, chose not to go on anymore work outings with them. My relationship with the org leadership also slowly dissipated. Socials stopped being as fun as they used to be. They mostly consisted of all the senior org people (J and S included) and their close friends who used to be in the org clumped together in one area and then all of the new people in another, shut out from the former group and forced to conserve amongst themselves. The synergy and commingling between old and new members that existed in the fall was well and truly dead. At this point, I understood that the elitism J said her and S had worked to dismantle hadn‚Äôt gone away at all. They had simply supplanted the old order with their new order. They became the very thing they swore to destroy. (Any nerds out there? ;)) 

I think I have made my case for my disappointment with J‚Äôs lack of leadership skills (or people skills for that matter) quite evident already. I had hoped that with S‚Äôs return, the org would become more united than ever before. She is, from what I could tell, a strong and determined and caring person. She told us at the first meeting after she returned that she cared for each and every one of us and that she looked forward to getting to know us better over the course of the year. Despite this promising beginning, however, her leadership left much to be desired. Indeed, the rest of the org‚Äôs leadership left much to be desired. They claim that they‚Äôre committed to unifying all of us and getting to know us as individuals, yet their actions don‚Äôt reflect those words. They, without fail, chose to not blend with the new members whenever the opportunity presented itself. They subconsciously excluded all of us from their circle and consequently established an elitist hierarchy of sorts within the org where there was a small privileged group at the top and everyone else at the bottom, and there is apparently no opportunity for upward mobility. No chance of fraternizing or building bonds with the senior members of our org.  

In essence, their hearts seemed to be in the right place, but their actions did not reflect their verbal commitments. They didn‚Äôt try, in my mind, anywhere near hard enough to reach out to us and get to know us. They could have and should have done better (even when taking into account their busy academic lives and their personal lives as well).

So, for these reasons, as well as for the reason of me not clicking with a majority of the people in the org old and new (which is perfectly fine and natural), I decided to leave the org. I would have left in early February if it wasn‚Äôt for personal reasons and commitments that obligated me to stay until early May. 

I suppose my departure is a bittersweet experience for me. Bitter because of all the resentment and disappointment that has stemmed from this experience. Sweet because I finally did leave, and at least now I know what it‚Äôs like to be in that org.

Are you guys going to seriously tell me that that's not a real issue? If you don't like how your SO looks or your SO doesn't like how you look then maybe that should be something that is considered. Of course there's a very very nice way to explain all of this but let's be mature about this and realize that sometimes people get comfortable in relationships or get really stressed. This might be lead to you or your SO being more overweight than you were while you were dating or before you got together and they might not find you as attractive as they used to. That's a thing that happens all the time and it leads to dead bedrooms so often. 

But some of the confessions that were posted sounded like their SOs were being rude. People need to realize that if/when you find your partner physically unattractive and especially if they find themselves unattractive too that's when you need to support them the most to do what they want/need to do to feel better physically and mentally. Things can always improve as long as people some work into it. Sometimes you just need to sit down and have a talk. I shouldn't have to say this but seeing the previously posted confessions idk. Be nice and be supportive. If you can't do those things, you need to work on yourself before you can be in the relationship you're in. 

If your partner however is comfortable with how they look and you're trying to impose your beauty standards on them then stop unless I guess they're physical health is at stake.

13919,2019-05-17 17:40:21,"Hello team!

I‚Äôm the guy from #12948 back on 3.0 (yes, I record the numbers of all my posted confessions). In case you don‚Äôt remember who I am, I‚Äôm the guy who had a crush on a girl in my org for 5 months and then was informed by her that she had a boyfriend 45 seconds before I was gonna ask her out.

I‚Äôm back to share with all of you the conclusions I've drawn and, more importantly, pass onto you a piece of advice based on a realization I had after smoldering about this over the last two weeks. 

(Note: I actually wrote a response to another post that responded to the original confession, but it got posted about 40 minutes before 3.0 got zucced, so‚Ä¶ yeah, didn‚Äôt have much time to circulate. Besides, this post will be of much more value and greater quality... I hope)

First things first, I am touched by the outpour of support and sympathy I got on the original post on 3.0. I was absolutely not expecting all of you to be so interested and I am genuinely floored and grateful. Thank you all so very much.

So, after two weeks of mulling over what I could have done differently, I personally felt that I wasn‚Äôt dealt a very good hand of cards to start with. I fell for a lady who was a year ahead of myself and graduating in 2 quarters (whilst I still had 8 to go), who held a leadership position in the org I was in, and supremely busy (and thus really difficult to talk to). I couldn‚Äôt get over the fact that she was (in the context of the org) my superior and thus I stopped myself from proactively trying to get to know her better and getting closer to her. I couldn‚Äôt get over the personal belief of how it is supremely inappropriate to develop feelings of romance for your higher-ups and that you ought to maintain a courteous, professional, and somewhat distanced relationship with them (a product of my upbringing). 

The person who responded to my original confession on 3.0 stated that I didn‚Äôt really know her for who she was and that I just had a severe case of infatuation. Perhaps, but I like to think I was able to cobble together a rough sketch of who she truly was based on what she‚Äôs shared with us (the org) and what I‚Äôve heard from others and then made an informed decision to go after her based on that sketch. She was a very strong woman who knew what she wanted from life and refused to take shit from anyone else yet immensely caring and compassionate. She looked out for the well-being of everyone in our org (it‚Äôs fairly small) and knew its quirks like the back of her hand. She was immensely intelligent and a politics and military buff (specifically military strategy). In short, she possessed a number of admirable qualities and traits, qualities that I look for in a lady (and my God, was she a fine lady).

Thinking back, I realize that even if she had been single and I had been more assertive, we probably would‚Äôve ended up getting together sometime in late February or early March, and considering that she‚Äôs graduating in June, I probably would‚Äôve been dumped around this time. I don‚Äôt think 3 months or so is nearly enough time to build the necessary foundations for a lasting off-campus relationship. And while I believe in Lord Tennyson‚Äôs words, ‚ÄúTis better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all‚Äù, I think the devastation would have been far worse had this been the case. Also, I think it‚Äôs safe to assume that she‚Äôs probably been dating this person she‚Äôs with for a fair while (most likely even before she returned from her business across the country in January).

So, given the realities of the situation, there really wasn‚Äôt much I could do. In fact, I think I was shit out of luck from the get-go. 

The only way I could‚Äôve gotten with her, realistically, was if I joined the org with her last year, which is a preposterous hypothetical. A) As a newbie freshman, I wasn‚Äôt ready to immerse myself into clubs yet. B) I wasn‚Äôt even sure I was going to join that org until earlier this year; and that‚Äôs only because it fit into my schedule. And C) I mean, how could I have known at the time that if I joined that org, I‚Äôd meet and fall for a very lovely single lady with whom I shared similar interests?

And that‚Äôs when it dawned on me.

It is highly unlikely (statistically speaking) that she is the only person on this campus with whom I‚Äôd click and I‚Äôd share similar interests. What if there are other women out here at UCSD who are just like her, with whom I can bond? It‚Äôs just they‚Äôre scattered all over campus in different lecture halls and colleges and orgs and I haven‚Äôt had to opportunity to encounter them yet.

And that gives me hope for the future.

It tells me that odds are I‚Äôll probably bump into another lady just like her who‚Äôd make me feel all of these things again (and, God willing, be single), so I needn‚Äôt worry too much. I shouldn‚Äôt aggressively go around campus looking for a new crush. I should concentrate on myself and live life to the fullest and enjoy my time here at UCSD and focus on self-improvement, on becoming the best person I can be. 

That is what I‚Äôve learned from this experience, and that‚Äôs the advice I want to pass on to you.

You, the reader, the lovely single men and women of the Confessions Community who are frustrated with your lot in life. The most wonderful people enter your life when you least expect them.

You may end up finding the woman/man of your dreams as well as friends for life, as well as learn a whole plethora of new things about yourself and the world around you (I know I‚Äôve found at least one of those two things). I know all of this sounds cliche and cloyingly optimistic, but it‚Äôs absolutely true. I guarantee it.

I remember being in a room with her male cousin and changing into a sheer, orange dress and going over to him on a chair and starting to make out. He could see all of me and I think I enjoyed it in the dream. But then, I just stopped. Later that night I guess I ended up with my friend and we talked and started to make out and eventually ended up having sex. Apparently all our friends who were staying in the house with us could hear it and they knew something weird was up cause I'm straight af. We were staying abroad and began to explore the city the next day like nothing happened. I woke up and was frankly alarmed and slightly grossed out by the idea of having sex with my best friend. Why did I dream that? Maybe I just need to find someone to make out with. ",,"sex, dating",,Fri,4.0,3.0,31.979999999999965,26.520000000000028,30.159999999999958,0.041,0.786,0.173,0.9815,11

You can not deny that we depend on animals such a chickens and cows to provide for the necessities of our nutrition. People will literally get mad and make it a bigger deal when animals get treated worse than human beings. Fuck off all of you who think like that. How can you put the life of an animal over a human. People are so sensitive these days they want to protect everything and get offended by everything. I am pretty liberal myself. I support gay marriage and gender equality and support to immigrants who need it. I am a male by the way. But I will not stand for people caring over animals more than humans.

It's better for the environment too (all packaging is compostable!). WHY CANT WE HAVE THIS TOO THO
I get that there are a few vegan things in the dining halls and markets, and we are lucky enough to have Roots on campus (which is always PACKED during lunch hours), but that's barely anything considering all the options for people who eat meat (remember, non-vegans still eat and enjoy vegan foods too!). There seems to be an increase in the vegan population as a whole, and many people are also trying to cut down on their consumption of animal products for a large variety of reasons, so it would make sense to provide more options. Also it's frustrating that there is only one dish on campus that I truly enjoy, and SOMETIMES I JUST WANT A NICE MILKSHAKE AND CHICK'N TENDERS WHEN MIDTERMS ARE DESTROYING ME EMOTIONALLY OKAY

In both cases, I recommended therapy, and in both cases, they said that there's nothing a therapist could tell them that they don't already know/didn't think of. One of them has essentially made me his therapist yet refuses to have an open mind about anything, and also can't share anything with his family/friends due to fear of judgement. 

I can't say that all men do this, or that only men do, but it really seems like a symptom of toxic masculinity.

Why can't you talk to your other guy friends instead of a random girl you met in lecture or at a party? Why do you think you're above getting help?

My hunch is that men are expected to be able to handle their emotions themselves, whereas women are seen as more emotional (and thus treatment is more acceptable). For guys, showing emotions, having mental health issues, or getting help would be a sign of weakness. 

Please take care of your mental health. Ask your guy friends how they're really doing. Support each other! And if you need to, be open to therapy, because it'll help.

I've spent some years trying to improve my attitude towards women and respect them. But recently I did something messed up, and now it seems like all of my effort was a waste, and that no matter how much work I put in I still fall back to the same harmful thoughts.

I think this goes deeper than society conditioning me to think like this (if that's plausible or a thing), but my behavior towards women seems to be the most troubling atm. I really do want to talk with my female friends and family about this, but I'm scared as hell that they'll just disregard my feelings about all of this, just throw solutions without listening, or see me in a negative light.

But I'm not here to share my life story. I want to be better than this. I don't like harming the people around me, regardless if I care for them or not.

I am really uncomfortable talking to other people about it and that's why I'm going to ask for some solid relationship advice on this page.
I have been in a relationship with my girlfriend for quite some time but soon she shifted and we were in a long distance relationship. We both feel like we really like each other and although there are challenges like every other relationship, I feel like in trying to be too perfect in the relationship I have made myself uncomfortable in it. We both give each other enough space and spend time apart. Although she makes time for me I feel that her new set of friends takes away her priority to me. I'm sorry but I want a relationship were we both come first for each other and it's sad to see how I have to fight for my spot.

I try to be supportive and caring but I'm just jealous when she's hanging 24*7 with her friends (and obviously guys make me more insecure) and also when she goes on trips with them. I know it's important to understand in a long distance that her life is still to continue and expand and I try to act normal on it. But it fucking sucks, she sees right through it and it has been repeating for long and I can't hold these standards anymore. I just want to be selfish in love and even though at the bottom of my heart I know she really loves me, it's just that she has this friendly personality and gets along with guys really well.

13742,2019-05-13 15:08:32,"My boyfriend has a secure folder for nudes and videos. A few months into our relationship, he got a new phone and decided to only transfer over our videos. When I saw the folder, however, there was still a video of him fucking his old fwb and he said he had no idea how it transferred over and he couldn't figure out how to delete it so he just left it. 

I try not to let jealousy influence my actions, so I haven't said anything other than the fact that he still had that video bothered me. He agreed it was wrong for him to still have that video, but never said anything about deleting it so I don't know if he still has it.

The fwb is his coworker and they stayed close friends after they stopped hooking up, until for some reason she turned cold to him and talked shit about him to his friends. This ended up isolating my bf from his friend group and he took it super hard. This isn't the first time she threw him under the bus. Still, they follow each other and stuff. Recently I guess she started to warm up to him again and they've been talking at work and stuff. 

The thing is, I come to work with him when I don't have class and just do my homework there (he works at a boba shop) because he gets lonely and frustrated by customers while on shift sometimes. It does make me very jealous when he has me come to his work and he ends up not even talking to me, and basically spends all his time talking to the fwb instead. Granted, they are working together so I guess its easier to talk to her than to me, but recently its been bothering me so much that I have to leave and walk to the Starbucks across the street instead.

I suppose I'm just venting here because I'm really frustrated that he would let someone into his life like that. I definitely have a huge personal bias since I did literally see my boyfriend fuck this girl. On a larger picture, he's always tried to stay friends with his exes, but they end up not talking anymore because the girls  dislike him after a while for some reason (like the fwb). I'm admittedly glad they don't talk, but it makes me uncomfortable that his doors are always open to them.

	So at the beginning of the school year, I came to college still kinda together with my girlfriend. We were gonna try long distance but we were gonna be far enough apart that we‚Äôd only ever be able to see each other on breaks. Things ended pretty quickly into the beginning of fall quarter, but we wanted to stay friends. But pretty much from when we broke up, she treated me terribly. She kept cancelling on plans to talk (or hang out when we were on break) and sometimes she didn‚Äôt even say she was cancelling and just went out to do something else instead. And through all of this, she still tried to tell me that she cared about me. She even bought a plane ticket to fly here and visit at the beginning of winter quarter. By the beginning of winter quarter though, I was really pissed off at all of her immature behavior and almost considered telling her not to come, but I didn‚Äôt in the end. About a week after she left SD, I decided to cut her out of my life because she was being a shitty friend, and conversations that we had when she visited really opened my eyes to some truths about her. She basically has no moral compass and wasn‚Äôt really bothered at all when one of her friends sexually assaulted someone else. She‚Äôs also extraordinarily immature and irresponsible and needs help doing the most basic tasks of living. I think cutting her out of my life was one of the best decisions I‚Äôve ever made because there‚Äôs a lot of things that I just couldn‚Äôt see when I was in a relationship with her, but I realized that she was really abusive. She would get mad at me for not knowing exactly what she was thinking a lot. She‚Äôd also say that we should break up, and expect me to convince her that we shouldn‚Äôt if she was unhappy with me. One time, when she called me over the summer and said that she thought we should break up, I told her that if she couldn‚Äôt handle long distance then it was fine and we should. She then got really mad at me because I was supposed to tell her that we should stay together. She even brought this incident up to some of our friends as if I had done something wrong by agreeing with her. Also, she was always wanting to do sexual activities. If I didn‚Äôt want to but she did, she‚Äôd get mad at me. She basically told me that if I was attracted to her then I would want to. She didn‚Äôt ever consider that sometimes I wasn‚Äôt in the mood or I didn‚Äôt want to do certain things. In the summer before college, she kept putting a lot of pressure on me to have intercourse (an activity which I have no interest in). I tried saying no, saying that we shouldn‚Äôt do it. But she kept pressing me and would ask, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you want to?‚Äù And I wasn‚Äôt really sure how to respond ever, because if I said no, she would get mad because that would mean that ‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt attracted to her.‚Äù I really didn‚Äôt want too though and my answers of ‚Äúno‚Äù weren‚Äôt working and she couldn‚Äôt take the hint. Luckily I was never forced to do that with her, mostly because for the end of our relationship, I mostly just stopped doing any kind of sexual activities with her.
There‚Äôs a part of me that doesn‚Äôt understand how I let myself be caught up in a relationship with somebody who‚Äôs so horrible (and it‚Äôs not just me, she‚Äôs lost a number of friends since starting college). On the other hand, I think I know so much more now. I know everything that I don‚Äôt want next time. And, I‚Äôm happy being single after basically being tethered to her for a year and I‚Äôve met people who are so much better now. I guess the story has a good ending.

Just gonna help the admins out by saying a couple of things here (as a longtime member and semi-regular commentator/contributor on 3.0 myself)

1) If you were one of those people who reported content on 3.0 that led to that group‚Äôs dissolution, I hope you‚Äôve learned your lesson. If you reported content with the intent to get 3.0 dissolved, then may you never get laid again (or ever, if you‚Äôve never gotten any before) and may your genitals see as much action as a restaurant kitchen in North Korea.
2) REPORT TO THE ADMINS, NOT TO ZUCCBOI
3) If you want to see this new community flourish as much as the old one, try to get as many people on this page as possible. Tell all your fellow Tritons about it, get them to join, and then tell them to tell all of their fellow Tritons about it. You possess the ability to make 4.0 as great if not greater than 3.0. So do your part to help us and yourself out, ladies and gents.
4) TELL THEM TO REPORT ANY CONTENT TO THE ADMINS AND NOT ZUCCBOI
5) Lovin‚Äô the new submissions page with all the new categories, admins! You guys are marvelous! Keep up the great work!

It started off quite well, hangouts etc. I'm admit that I can be a bit dumb at times and my roommates caught on. Coming into 2nd quarter they started teasing me for it and I played it off as a joke. That's how it started off as a joke. It escalated pretty quickly where there is not a day that goes by where they didn't make fun of me. I feel like I'm middle school all over agian and it fuckin sucks. Everyone else in our friend group noticed it to and questioned them on why they are doing this. Their explanation was that ""it's just what friends do"". They even brag about it like that is how ""close"" we are because I can ""stand"" it.  Really though, I got to the point where I'm discourage to even talk to them, in fear of saying something wrong or dumb and have them just go off on me. I hate being in dorm because they're there and after they go off on me I just leave the dorm for hours and act like I'm studying. I cry here and there because of them because I just feel like I'm being bullied in fucking college like I was in throughout my childhood. The one time they caught me crying, they said ""it's just joke, why are you crying"". I'm know they good people but I wish they were more considerate. I'm scared to tell them what I feel about them, since I will probably be told that I'm to sensitive( I've always been told that) and dont know how to take a joke. I living with them next year and I dont think my mental state cant handle it anymore. I feel like I'm trapped because all of my friends are also their friends and I have no one to talk to.

He, Barr, Mnuchin, and countless others are claiming he is completely exonerated, and didnt collude, but then are stopping investigations from obtaining documents that, if they are telling the truth, would clear him. They literally have no reason to hide his tax returns, the Mueller report, etc. unless they are hiding something that could be detrimental to his presidency. We deserve the truth. 

Had Obama done anything REMOTELY close to this, Republicans would have said we have a tyrannical government and used their 2nd amendment rights by now on him. But no, Obama's biggest scandal was wearing a bike helmet when cycling once.  

For the Christians that support trump, I'm a Christian, but notice far too often that the majority of my religion and pastors support trump. This is insane. He has no regard for our faith and is playing the majority of us like fools, saying stuff like ""he brought back saying Merry Christmas"" to pander to the gullible among us, which I'm realizing is far too many. Nearly all of his policies go directly against what we stand for.

I know that there is separation of church and state, but for those Christians, stop and ask yourself ""what would Jesus do?"" Would he really want tax cuts for the rich and corporations and to throw millions of people off healthcare? Would he really want us to put a wall up and stop people from coming here for a better life, or tell those fleeing dictatorships and war torn countries to go back because we, as the richest country in the world, cant help them? Would he really want us to continue to pollute and destroy the one planet he gave us when there are plenty cleaner alternatives just because some rich people's businesses would go under? If you think yes to any of these, you are utterly mistaken for what Jesus stood for. Jesus always looked out for the poor and low among us and trump would never even voluntarily say hi to a person like that unless he knew it would be caught on camera and get him a few votes. 

It doesnt matter if you call yourself Christian, if you don't at least try to act like he did and help others, even strangers, like he calls on us to do, you are not a real Christian and he will judge you that way.

I'm not sure but I get really insecure about being the one on the sideline since it's always seemed that way in the past. In high school, I jumped from friend group to friend group until I found people I really connected with but then college happened and we became separated.

Yes I have more traits than just being a 'nice guy' that others do appreciate: giving, empathetic, strong valued, adventurous, ambitious, etc
I am more than looks and I know relationships are more than looks, however most of college culture (who are not religious, like me) cannot relate to me bc I don't go to parties, drink, etc.
These aspects are what I define as being a goodboi. I am more than just these traits still.
My point is that these traits are no longer appreciated in this society practically in college social life though they are voiced out, and it's sad for ppl like me who have been raised and built into this unwanted form.
And though you say that being a 'nice guy' is the most basic of human decency my point is that the vast majority of relationships do not have that requirement and tend towards acts that are currently against my values.
I'm not saying these confessions to gain pity (I have enough self pity) but rather to gain advice on how to move forward to be more socially/relationally wanted. Should I ammend my values?

13326,2019-05-07 13:39:39,"Hello all, it‚Äôs the guy from #12948 again

Just wanted to take this opportunity to respond to #13048 (as well as anyone else who is curious) by saying that after about four days of deep introspection and retrospection about this I‚Äôve drawn roughly the same conclusions you‚Äôve drawn. 

First and foremost, I definitely should have been more proactive and vigorous in my efforts to getting to know her better and building up that bridge. Secondly, I also shouldn‚Äôt have waited 22 weeks to finally pop the question.

Truth be told, I have a rough and I think fairly accurate picture of what kind of person she is judging from what I‚Äôve seen (in person and through our org‚Äôs group chat) and what I‚Äôve been told by others. I didn‚Äôt mention this in my previous posts out of concerns for anonymity, but I fell for her not because she was just a very physically attractive lady (which was absolutely was), but because she was a passionate, patient, and caring soul with a big heart. She was someone who looked out for each and every one of us in the org no matter how well or little she knew us to make sure we were safe and sound (physically, mentally, and emotionally), someone who was a self-professed politics and military strategy nerd (which I find very neat, since I‚Äôm also a political/military/history buff) with a dark and sometimes morbid sense of humor (which I also really appreciate), and someone who doesn‚Äôt take shit from anyone else (which is probably the #1 reason why I fell for her; she was proud of who she was and comfortable with herself). 

Does all of this mean she definitely would‚Äôve been as good as I made her out to be? No, but she certainly piqued my interest to the point where I decided it was worth a shot. I may not have a solid answer on who she was precisely, but I had a rough and solid enough sketch, and I liked what I saw. 

Was I aware it could‚Äôve been a really short term relationship considering that she‚Äôs graduating in 4 weeks? Yes, but to be honest, even if we didn‚Äôt make it past June, at least it we would‚Äôve had those couple of months with each other, a couple of months of mutual happiness and companionship, and I think that‚Äôs pretty worthwhile too. As Lord Tennyson said, ‚ÄúTis better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all.‚Äù (Yeah, I admit I‚Äôm a bit of a hopeless romantic)

The reason I wasn‚Äôt more proactive with her, that I didn‚Äôt take more risks and fight like hell and allowed myself to just coast was because I saw her as my boss, essentially. She was my superior in my org and where I‚Äôm from, it is absolutely inappropriate to develop romantic feelings for your higher-ups. You maintained a courteous, professional, and somewhat distanced relationship with them and that was that. I struggled to fight this mindset throughout the five months we had known each other. I couldn‚Äôt convince myself that she wouldn‚Äôt be offended if I tried to get to know her better even when it was blatantly obvious that she wouldn‚Äôt (she had the org over at her place multiple times for drinks and party games and she joined in the fun with us). The whole concept just felt very foreign to me. In the end, I think it‚Äôs this mindset that caused me grief. I personally think I did have a shot with her, because from what I could tell, she and her boyfriend hooked up very recently. But I let my mind, which demanded strict respectful formality towards her at all times, prevail over my heart and common sense. Thus, I stopped myself from being bold with her and getting into a position where I could‚Äôve shot my shot sooner and preempted the rest of this story. Essentially, I was in the right place at the right time, originally, and then I simply stalled for far too long. 

Oh well. I should have done better, much better, but at least I was able to catch my mistakes from this time around, and that‚Äôs a pretty damn good consolation prize, if you ask me. 
I‚Äôve decided to put the focus back on myself again in the meanwhile. I‚Äôm trying to get back on top of classwork (I‚Äôve always been a first-class procrastinator, hahahaha) as well as trying to get back into the gym again (but it‚Äôs always so damn hard to find the time to do so, hahahaha). Life has gotten much better for me over these past few days, now that I‚Äôve made peace with myself over this whole episode.

I‚Äôm pleased to hear that my story touched you. I was not expecting the outpouring of sympathy and support that I got from the Confessions Community. I didn‚Äôt think so many of you would be interested in my story That genuinely took me by surprise and I am genuinely very deeply touched by that. Again, thank you all so very much.

13317,2019-05-07 11:56:06,"Tl;dr I Think i have developed mild depression from this shitty school.

After being here for two years, I have come to realize how sad it is just to be at UCSD.  I know that everyone describes this school as ""socially dead"" but its really been getting to me lately with just how depressing it is to be here. I'm writing this in biomed and i look around and all I see is people stuck to there computer screens looking at lecture slides or YouTube, waiting for their next exam. Its not even in libraries, its everywhere i go. People spend week after week studying to maintain their GPA because its ""so important to them"" and because the job market is so competitive now. Most teachers and students don't even seem to care about education, they only care about the end result (yes there are a few outliers, there are people here that enjoy their lives but from my perspective its a very select few). The more I look at it the more everyone to me looks so spineless; they only care about their grades, they only care about internships or career fairs, they don't even care if they like the shitty major their in (most people I've talked to hate their major or lie and say ""oh its interesting"" when they complain about it every other fucking second).

And i feel like ive become one of these people. Ive become a spineless slave to the american education system. and I know this sounds like a rant, ill probably get comments like ""Op, youre only saying this because youre not doing as well as you want to,"" but this is how i truly feel. I pretty much hide the fact that im depressed to my friends, family and my SO. I was fine in high school because it was so easy for me compared to college, but I feel as if all of my time and energy now is put into just passing my fucking classes. The more I think about it the more i feel like I don't belong here. I hate my major and Im only doing it for the money involved in my career path. The fact that I fail almost every test because of one question thats worth literally half of the test pisses me off because basing my GPA off of a few questions is a shit way to measure my knowledge. sometimes i feel like id rather work at a fucking Taco Bell than live a life where UCSD Administration is shitting on my mental health.

He wasnt planning on using it immediately, just keeping it as sort of a peace of mind, but he's telling me now that he doesn't think he'll make it to the end of the week. I've been begging him to get help for a while, and he's calling CAPS tomorrow, but he's planning on withholding enough information to prevent him from getting institutionalized. I know that being in a psych ward doesn't really do anything but physically prevent you from hurting yourself, that he'd still be suicidal when he leaves, and that he'd rather die than go back to a psych ward, but he needs serious help ASAP. He has the philosophy that when someone wants to commit, they should be allowed to do so, but he hasn't really tried any treatments. He's passionate and incredibly talented in what he does, he's done really important work with some of the comp sci professors on campus, has internships lined up for summer, and is almost guaranteed to get into grad school here because of the profs he's worked with (he wants a phD). 
This bout of depression was all triggered by a breakup. He's definitely had issues before, but right now it's a response to his ex.

13243,2019-05-06 20:29:56,"I fall in love so easily, and when I do, I fall really hard.

Being hopelessly romantic sucks because I have so much love to give and a lot of people are just so great. How can you just pick one person to fall in love and spend your life with when there are plenty of fantastic people in the world that you can fall in love with? I'm not down with an open-relationship or any kind of polygamy so that's out of the question. I'll maybe try it out but it doesn't really appeal to me so probably not.

I just want to have romantic walks on the beach, hold hands, and embrace so many people. I'm not too into sex or anything since I'm asexual but I absolutely crave romance. I guess you can say that I'm in love with falling in love, heh. I always notice when I'm swooning, sighing, or daydreaming about people and I can't help but smile since the feeling of being flustered by love is so sublime, it fills me up with so much happiness and emotion that I have to scream into my pillow. The blood rushing to my face and my heart skipping a beat when thinking of or spending time with any of my crushes are two of the greatest feeling in the world.

I don't know if any of them caught on but I don't know what I'd do if I started dating someone again then start feeling love for someone that's not my partner. I don't think that I deserve anyone spending love on me because I can't spend mine on just them... I would never want to break someone's heart or hurt anyone because I can't control my emotions. I'd never physically or emotionally cheat on someone, I just don't know how my partner would react to how I feel for others. I don't think that they'd understand, I know that I don't understand myself most of the time. Would they be mad? Certainly they would be sad. What if the relationship ends sour because of my feeling for someone else? I don't ever want to put anyone through that.

Maybe I don't deserve to be loved myself, maybe I'm just selfish by choosing how to spend my love. I'm not entirely certain. Maybe the love that I constantly feel inside could be spent on just one person one day, I hope that's true, we'll just have to see. Maybe I just think that the feeling I have in droves is love and I never experienced true love. Just the thought of experiencing a feeling greater than what I feel now, especially for one person, makes me so excited and warm, it's probably the third greatest feeling. For now I will remain single and enjoy the feeling of loving everyone.

If I had a positive interaction with you, I might have some sort of crush on you. If I ask or find out your name, I probably have a crush on you. If we're friends and we hang out, I definitely have a crush on you. Romantic or platonic, I love you. Everyone is beautiful, don't get caught up too much about your looks. Personalities are much more easier to fall in love with (A genuine smile and pretty eyes are to die for though!! I love looking into someone else's eyes!!!!).

But a few weeks pass, and I start to develop feelings for her. I was so sure I was straight, I had never been so confused in my life. I tried to pretend for a few months, but one night I just couldn't lie to myself anymore. I'm still confused on my sexuality, but I know for sure I like this girl.

I tried to dismiss my feelings because I know my family won't be supportive, and I don't like standing out in a crowd. But it was absolutely impossible. I had never fallen for anyone this hard before. NEVER, not even to the slightest degree. And the feelings only grew stronger as I got to know her better. We were really good friends, and sometimes I thought I got signals from her. Guess I was wrong, though.

Over winter break, I confessed my feelings. Her first reaction was to ask me if I was sure, and my heart fell. She basically told me that it wasn't a good time for her, that she still needed to figure some things out. I, of course, respected that. A few weeks later I asked her about it in person. tl;dr she said that she doesn't not like me but also added that she doesn't know when she'll be ""better"" mentally to start a relationship (but she didn't tell me exactly what the issue was), that it might take a few months or a few years. Me being infatuated with her, I told her I'd wait.

Even though we both agreed to remain friends, things just haven't been quite normal since. I fell into the most depressive state in my life I've ever been, questioning my feelings, questioning why this had to happen to me, of all people. It was almost as if it was worse than if she had just flat out told me that she didn't like me back. And I hadn't realized that I had, for so many months, depended on this girl for my happiness. Get through studying for this test, I would tell myself, and you can hang with her afterwards.

I knew I needed to get over her, knew that I needed to be okay with being alone. And now, a few months later, I'm glad to say that I'm better. I still love this girl, but I'm in a much better mental state. The only problem is that whenever I see her, all I feel is sad. The jittery feeling I once felt every time I saw her had been replaced by a tremendous heap of just plain old sadness.

And just today when we were in a group, she said she doesn't like banking on the idea that one day she'll find her someone. I don't know if she said that purposely, or if she thinks I've gotten over her.

Either way, I haven't. I still dream of us having a future only to stop myself and feel like absolute shit and all gross on the inside. It would probably be easier if I stop being friends with her altogether, but I feel like that would just be a dick move, and our mutual friends (who don't know this is happening) would definitely know something is up.

Anyways, I've left out some plot details because they pose too great of a risk in ruining my anonymity, but this is the gist of what has happened.

You also mentioned she was graduating, so even if she did say yes there was no guarantee anything wouldve worked out after this coming June. The right person will come around eventually.

Whatever you're directing your criticisms to has no clue who you are and if you're even connected to (for example) the club you're complaining about. 

Now for the tough love:
This is a university. Be an adult. Step up and be assertive. Whether changes happen or not is ultimately up to the club, but at least you can say, ""I tried,"" instead of sitting behind a screen like a coward. Just be brave. It might seem scary at first, but it shows that you care and that you're a mature, responsible adult. Plus, you get to praise yourself later for taking progressive action.

So I met her at Geisel today (a day late due to scheduling conflicts) to inform her that I was leaving the org that we are both a part of (for totally unrelated reasons). I had planned to save asking her out on a date until the end of that brief chat. During the course of this conversation, she went on about her hectic midterm schedule and how the week has been for her thus far. 

Then she said, ""I had planned to meet up with my boyfriend, but then we couldn't, because I was so busy.""

And then my heart shattered into a million pieces.

We had known each other for five months, and in all the time that I've known her, she's never brought him up in any way until now. This was the first time I have ever heard of her boyfriend. (Although admittedly, I felt in my bones for the longest time that she may be taken, and oh, how it hurts for your worst fears to finally be realized).

So with all that in mind, I chose to end our conversation with a simple farewell and not pop the question or even reveal my true feelings about her, since I felt that would've been wrong and disrespectful and immature and undignified.

What is getting me mad and depressed now wasn't anything she did. She did nothing wrong. I'm not mad at myself either. I have concluded that I did everything I possibly could given what I was given. What's getting me is the fact that this is the third woman in a row I've had a major crush who turned out to be already taken when I pop the question. 

I've never had a girlfriend before and fate is making it soul-crushingly hard for me to find one. I've never ever had a fair shot when it came to shooting my shot (that is, I've never got to ask out someone who was single at the time of my asking). Now, I understand that them's the breaks and that's just how things turn out sometimes, but it still doesn't stop me from getting mad about it (and I'm sure a number of you can sympathize with that sentiment).

I don't look for casual hookups or just sex or anything of that nature. I want something that is meaningful and deep and real with someone that's kindly and mature and sensitive and fun. Consequently, I'm somewhat picky with the people that I crush on. So I've never had very many crushes on people (two in the past two years).

I'm trying as hard as I can to keep the negative thoughts away, the thoughts of worthlessness and being completely undateable and the like (as well as the typical thoughts of ""Oh, I'll never find anyone quite like her"" that I typically have around this time). But it's hard to feel like you're worthy of someone or someone will ever be interested in you or you'll ever find someone when the powers that be keep leading you to wonderful women who are taken. It truly makes you wonder what the fuck you did to deserve something like this.

There's also a bittersweet finality to all of this. I've crushed on her for five months and now all of that planning and hopes and dreams and preparation is done. It's all over, and I feel this great emptiness in my heart.

(If you're wondering why I didn't ask earlier, it was because there were conflicting commitments on Sun God weekend (to her and the rest of our org) that I had to fulfill and it would not have been appropriate if I asked before those commitments were fulfilled. It might've made things quite awkward, so I'm happy I held off from that.)

If any of you have any tips on how to move on from the pain that I feel in my heart right now (or words of encouragement or advice or anything of that nature), then please do let me know, because I don't want to resort to anything stupid and potentially dangerous like drinking the pain away.

So yeah, that's the thrilling conclusion of that story.

Confessions community, thank you so very much for all the support and advice that you have given me (as well as anything you'll give me now in the comments section here). I read through every single comment you put on my posts and took them to heart. You really are a magnificent bunch.

And so, to end this post, I just want to say this:
""If you're reading this (and you know who you are), well now you know how I feel about you and what kind of state I'm in now. But please don't worry about me. Things like this happen. It's all a part of the natural cycle of life and I will recover and move on from it. I still stand by every single thing I said to you today on the third floor of Geisel, how much of a lovely person you are and how it's people like you make the world a better place for us all. I earnestly hope that your boyfriend counts his blessings each and every day for having someone as wonderful as yourself in his life. I don't know if our paths will cross again in the future, but if it doesn't, I wish you nothing but the very best of luck (not that you'll really need it) as well as success and happiness wherever you go in whatever you do. Godspeed and thank you for everything.""",,update very long,,Fri,40.0,32.0,246.05199999999934,146.86400000000032,210.70600000000093,0.096,0.726,0.177,0.9982,17

BUT ya‚Äôll can‚Äôt just be going all ‚Äúdon‚Äôt approach girls‚Äù and then bitch about ‚Äúwhy can‚Äôt I connect with anyone in rl‚Äù.

I am not the type to join orgs and clubs because I am simply not interested and even when I do go to ‚Äúevents‚Äù, guys rarely approach me. They do stare though, as if your glare is enough for me to wet my panties. It is not. I need an intellectual conversation, an emotional connection, and at least a dozen of solid jokes from you‚Ä¶then I‚Äôm all yours. I‚Äôm obviously joking btw, but low-key high-key feel free to print a pack of memes/jokes and give them to me if you see me in public. 

Now, I don‚Äôt have an issue getting matches and meeting people from tinder. I usually meet about 5 guys a month when I‚Äôm bored and want some ‚Äúmale attention‚Äù. I think it is a fucking great tool in 21st century because guys don‚Äôt have the balls anymore (or maybe just in Cali) and this page is a damn proof. I have nothing against the page per se (love it and love ya‚Äôll) BUT c‚Äômon we all fucking know the difference between being a creep and being a normal guy approaching someone. 

What I am saying is that there were a few posts about ‚Äúdo you girls wanna be approached more‚Äù and some comments were like ‚Äúnah, stay away dude‚Äù. WELL. As a subjectively relatively attractive female (according to tinder statistics and my friends), BY ALL FUCKING MEANS APPROACH. 

Approach people in your classes, people you sit next to, people in line for coffee. Ask to borrow pens, ask academic questions, ask for directions. Be creative. How? Honestly test the waters and try different neutral pick up lines . Say ‚Äúyou have a nice perfume‚Äù or ‚ÄúI like your shoes‚Äù while in line for a coffee or after a class. I usually compliment guys on their outfit because none of ya‚Äôll use nice cologne :( which is actually sad because male cologne is fucking bae‚Ä®‚Ä®

So yeah, if the reaction is positive (aka the girl doesn‚Äôt give you a death stare), proceed to ask for an ‚Äúadvice‚Äù. A question is all it takes. Asking for ‚Äúhelp‚Äù is like a solid strategy when you want to get something. You are giving the other person a sense of ‚Äúpower‚Äù over the situation‚Äî this applies to life in general. ‚ÄúBy the way, do you happen to know where the room/building/etc is?‚Äù. Be nice/smiley and bring ‚Äúpositive energy‚Äù. Don‚Äôt overdo it and come off ‚Äúneedy/clingy‚Äù though. The initiative should (ideally) come from a girl, because this would increase the chances of a successful contact exchange. 

What I am trying to say is that for me personally there is simply not enough OPPORTUNITY for interactions with guys around me, which is why I use tinder and enjoy it for literally ‚Äúmeting new people‚Äù. Like yeah, I‚Äôm probably (read: definitely) not gonna like it when a guy is clearly ‚Äúeyeing‚Äù me and has a ‚Äúthirsty‚Äù look (yes! some of you do) BUT, what I would greatly appreciate is a sense of ‚Äúcreating room for interaction‚Äù, where, if I want.. I can take the conversation further.

I am just fucking TIRED approaching guys on my own because I‚Äôm traditional that way, so what.

Just like how I am exposed to a lot of black people and hispanics in college who come from relatively well off families. Ill be honest, where i come from doesn't have many black people. theres only latinx and Koreans. But lemme tell you my friends and I, both hispanic and asian... we both struggle lmao. 
We definitely face different types of discrimation, but its discrimination nonetheless. To me it seems like there are equal number of successful hispanic and korean business owners and equal number of hispanics and koreans who struggle. 
Let me tell you, most of my asian friends from back home have it WAY worse economically than some of my black and hispanic friends here. 
Take my own family for example. My mom had to work under the table for less than minimum wage for most of my life as a single mom until the Obama administration did all that shit for us which applies to both koreans and hispanics. The same can be said for almost all my asian friends back home. 
I feel all yall. Al lot of the asian friends i made in college come from pretty nice families compared to where i come from lol. But that doesnt mean were all rich. 
In fact, the poverty rate for asian americans is actually higher than the national average. 
I remember freshman year when we (both hispanic and korean) all met up during winter break, we laughed our asses off about how much we struggled in our childhood compared to our new peers since we had NO FUCKING IDEA how much we actually struggled LOL. 
I have a few asian friends from back home who are well off, but i also have a few hispanic friends back home who come from families just as well off. 
For both communities, majority of us came to the states on a visa. And for both, a few of us came illegally through the border. Idk if yall know, but in the 90s, quite a few koreans had to fly to argentina and then go to mexico and then finally LA.

To me, it makes absolutely no sense how forming an arbritrary agreement with one person prevents you from feeling attraction towards another. ***Your body does not ""know"" you agreed to be exclusive to someone, so being unable to form new romantic feelings towards another person makes absolutely no sense***. I think what's more likely is once someone is cuffed they spend majority of their time and social energy on that one person so other people do not seem attractive not because of choice, but because of the nature of relationships and the amount of time and social energy spent with one's S/O. Consider this: John and Jane are in a relationship with one another. Jane moves to another State for grad school. There she meets Brian, someone who is kind, attractive, funny, smart, definitely everything she wants in an S/O, and they start spending enormous amounts of time together. You're telling me that she wouldn't once consider having a relationship with him instead of John? Because of what? The ""forces of love""? I don't think so.

12632,2019-04-30 13:46:12,"Dear Obnoxiously Loud People in the Library and Study Areas at UCSD,

I write to you all to earnestly ask that you all be more respectful of your fellow students with whom you are sharing the area with. 

I understand that the library (the non-quiet area) and study areas are not quiet study zones so some talking is okay. I mean I do it too. But the noise level is just amazing loud - I can hear you all talking even though I have my noise cancelling headphones on.

I understand that some people are teaching and helping their friends with materials from class and that's totally cool. However, you're not the only ones using the area. 

Like I said before, these areas are a communal, shared areas so, though conversing is okay (especially near Audrey's) but can we all be a bit more considerate of others and talk quietly (remember from grade school ""indoor/library voices""?), not have loud conversations on the phone and keep the loud laughing and horse playing to a minimum? 

Now, you may say, ""If you don't like the noise, then go to the quiet areas upstairs"" or that these silence-longing students ought to study elsewhere but that just defeats the purpose of a library. Furthermore, the upper levels can be full and therefore not always possible.

This applies to the study rooms as well. They're called ""study rooms"" and not a ""lounge"" for a reason.

As an esteemed Berkeley student once said, ""Hey! Hey! Hey! This is library!"" (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHhy2Gk_xik for your reference for those who don't get the reference).

Again, please be courteous of your fellow students trying to study.

12729,2019-04-30 01:13:17,"No one cares. The thought that echoes in my mind every morning when I wake, when I brush my teeth, when I go to school, and until I drift into the emptiness at night. To realize that it‚Äôs no one‚Äôs responsibility to care is a heart shattering realization. To know that you‚Äôre falling deeper and deeper into a pit and know that any one of the people you‚Äôre falling past could reach out and pull you back into the safety of love, acceptance, and empathy. Maybe they don‚Äôt know you‚Äôre suffering. Maybe they‚Äôre not paying attention. Maybe they have their own problems to figure out. Maybe they realize how much of a burden it is to be your friend and it‚Äôs easier to avoid. Regardless of the reason, the truth is that you‚Äôre alone. Alone with your thoughts, alone with your feelings, alone with your cares and desires in this world. 

This sense of loneliness compounds with every glance at a kissing couple, friends laughing, etc. You ask yourself why other people have friends, have significant others, have love, acceptance, have fun, and the only rationale explanation is that you weren‚Äôt chosen. This feeling of being the last one picked, the odd one out, is something you‚Äôve become all too familiar with. From gym class and teams in middle school to projects in college, the polite ones glance down to avoid eye-contact or say, ‚ÄúUmmm, I‚Äôm actually already with x.‚Äù You realize pretty quickly that you‚Äôve been standing for too long, left out hanging. Your body squirms with the discomfort from the gaze of others. Your entire existence is skipped over until the silence of the second last person being picked and you slowly drag yourself over to the other team. Last picked alludes to some notion of being chosen when that couldn‚Äôt be further from the truth. You weren‚Äôt chosen. An unlucky team or person was stuck with you. You‚Äôre given to someone who doesn‚Äôt want you, like an ad placed in your mailbox or more adeptly a parking ticket stuck onto someone‚Äôs windshield. You didn‚Äôt choose this life of torment and yet it was likewise thrust upon you.

You ask yourself where did it all go wrong? How could you be born into this world like everyone else yet end up so different, so far from everyone else? Everyone‚Äôs origin story is different. Mine began in middle school. Before, I felt like I was just another kid for the most part. Things changed when I was evicted from my elementary school and forcibly placed into middle school. I was warned that the school might be a bad culture fit. Like the naive kid I was, I didn‚Äôt give it much thought. The message that I was unwanted was slowly bled into my mind. From the teachers to the students, it was made clear that no one wanted me there. I didn‚Äôt belong. I wasn‚Äôt white. I wasn‚Äôt rich. I didn‚Äôt play club sports. I didn‚Äôt wear Quick Silver, Hurley, or the stereotypical clothes from other students. A memory etched eternally in my mind is returning to class after lunch and since all the boys played outside, we were all sweaty and dirty. My eighth grade teacher greeted each of them with a smile but that smile quickly vanished when her eyes laid on me. ‚ÄúGo clean yourself up, you look absolutely disgusting‚Äù still echoes in my mind and the feeling of being lesser than are still branded in mind with a wound as fresh as the day those hot iron words struck my ears. This realization wasn‚Äôt something that happened overnight. It was like most things in this world, slow and steady. You begin as a flat grassy field with just a small trickle of disgust and disdain for your existence trickling through and before you know it, you‚Äôre left with a huge hole in your existence, a giant grand canyon of with thunderous waves of anxiety, depression, and self-loathing.

Time passes and the people around you change. You change schools and eventually leave to a different city for college. Your tormentors and peers long forget about you with you being a distant memory ever shrinking in their rear view mirror as they drive toward their rest, discovering the fruits of life, things that make things worth living, friends, love, and success. You cough as the dust spun up by the tires catches in your throat and eventually they fade from your view. But they‚Äôve left their mark upon you forever. What was outside and external, these thoughts of not being accepted, of being ugly, of not being good enough have slowly but surely seeped through the pores of your skin and now have corrupted your mind. They don‚Äôt need to be there to say it anymore because your mind already says it for them. You don‚Äôt need to hear the laughter from others when they make fun of your feelings on a crush, you now tell yourself, no, you know that you‚Äôre not good enough. Undeserving of love. Undeserving of affection. Undeserving of friendship. Filled with rage at yourself for being stupid enough to think that you could ever have those things you saw others enjoy. The hand of life slaps your childlike hands away from the candy at the supermarket checkout counter like a scolding mother. 

How many bad days does it take to change you a person? To corrupt what one was good, kind, and loving into something cynical? Maybe every rejection, every mean jab ever made, maybe every hurtful thing is like a stab to your heart until the skin scars and hardens. How many more days can you take before you decide it's preferable to die and kill yourself rather than go on another day locked inside of your mind, your life? What will be the final thing that breaks you so utterly and completely you lose all hope for life? Do you know what or when it will be or does it strike from nowhere? I know not the answers to these questions but am afraid I may find out the answer soon.

I need a wake up call from my internet anonymous friends. 
So I've been in a long term relationship since HS to undergrad and now through masters. Since I am earning my masters in ucsd, the relationship became long distance.
Over the past year, as my girl has been working and traveling, our connection fell short. Her personality changed a bit mostly due to working environment, became a bit more commanding, type A stuff. Her interests shifted into photography, Instagram fame, tinder, thrill seeking... I mean, I know, tinder is already a red flag. I went clear with her about my opinions on dating applications, and she insists and promises that it is for sole usages to get followers(???). Idk man, don't ask me. Partly maybe just because she's lonely and in need of attention? Dude the logic is a mess, anyway, an exclusive simple relationship was my request. 
Anyhow, we had verbal arguments. I felt unloved and discarded. I realized how much has changed over the past year. I don't think I've changed much, video games, exercise, food, talking over phone, work grinding cycle seems fairly balanced to me. fuck im drifting away from topic. Knowing her past well, I can understand the reason for who she's become today. But at the same time, my unrequited love and affection had me in some agony.

After graduating, I will be heading back home for M.D. degree, which is a few states away from her. Asked her if she'd like to come back, she said she is content with current workplace so give her a year to make some savings. I feel that I am slowly losing grip of this relationship. Even if we keep on to have ourselves to be loyal to each other, we don't quite click anymore. It's hard to be exciting or flirty when your partner isn't in the mood. I don't remember what I was going to ask for in the first place. I'm just a bit sad and intoxicated. 

If you kindly may, gimme some inputs or suggestions on what to do.
Undoubtedly, I have a privileged and loving life which I am thankful for.  If a seven years relationship fails, ggs go next I guess, what can ya do, hell isn't breaking loose.

I say this because the friends I have now are people who I can relate to. One of them has to support themselves with two jobs because they are in poverty. Another one is a refugee from the middle east and a DACA recipient. I myself am also in a disadvantaged situation: hereditary neurodegenerative eye disease, and my family of five still lives in a 2-bedroom apartment.  

We don't take an Uber to go get boba and hot pot because we don't have 50 dollars to blow for a single night. None of us have the luxury to spend a Saturday night getting drunk and throwing up because we all work on Sundays. 

I am so thankful for these friends I have made. They understand me as I understand them. I don't have to pretend to not like boba anymore because I can't afford it. I don't have to order the least expensive thing at BJ's because holy shit I ain't paying 15 dollars for one fucking meal anymore. I don't have to go hang with friends anymore simply because I don't have money to pay for the booze anymore.

Instead, we find free events and share them with each other. We took advantage of the Sun God $5 lyft to go off campus to downtown. We made our own sandwiches for the day. We buy dining dollars for 2:1 ratio because it is such a bargain.

If you respond to someone saying they don‚Äôt like Californians by raving about how awesome California is and how much you love the beach and where you‚Äôre from, you totally missed the point. No one‚Äôs mad you like living here and don‚Äôt want to leave !!!! Nobody would argue that the weather and the beach and having cultural hubs like LA and SF is bad. That why we come here!! 
The problem is with the people who grow up here, have never left, and thus have no perspective about life outside of California. And I get not everybody has the means to travel, that‚Äôs understandable. But I have had too many people who grew up in the Bay or OC and never lived anywhere else spew opinions at me about why the rest of the country sucks and why people in the Midwest or South are bad. It‚Äôs nonsense. And people saying they have no desire to leave EVER kinda just show how little they care about the rest of the country, which is very stereotypical for you all.
Part of what drove me to go out of state for college was to live in a totally new place and be around people from different backgrounds and who have different experiences. So coming here and being met with a lot of Californians who have so many preconceived notions about the rest of the country and no desire to actually learn about them is INCREDIBLY disheartening.

12202,2019-04-26 04:59:56,"to #11721, after seeing your three posts and reading all the harsh comments from other people, I have to say that I can relate with you as a fellow Christian. I'm not a guy, but I also get slightly turned on when I see some attractive guys (face-wise or body-wise). Since I'm a girl, Idk if I would be labeled as a ""creep"" like you were. Yes, there is something immoral about such reactions, but that doesn't define us as creeps. I'd say that someone is a creep if they end up crossing boundaries, such as taking photos, stalking, verbally/physically harassing the person, etc. Hormones can be hard to control, especially in college.
In response to your predicament though, I'd say that you have to decide whether your spiritual life or physical life is more important. Of course, nothing seems to be going wrong for your friends who have sex, but that's only based off of your judgement. God is there to judge, so you only need to focus on yourself. What happens to other people isn't going to necessarily be the same for you. You might end up feeling extremely guilty if you have sex before marriage. You'll further distance yourself away from God as well. I'm a Christian, but I've had multiple sexual partners and I can't tell you how guilty I feel. I'm worried about how it affects my relationship with God. But then again, I also believe that He already knew I would have these sins. Under religious standards, sex is meant to be a gift that you enjoy with your special person. I personally support your sexual abstinence because it'll bring you greater rewards. If you do give in to that temptation, it'll be hard to control it afterwards. Just a fair warning. and of course, with any sin, you should try to repent for it. If you don't, you're kinda just disregarding His authority. Whatever happens, God has love for everyone, so don't feel burdened.
And to the non-religious people, I know you're extremely skeptical of Christianity, but Christianity, and any other religion, does provide meaning, guidance, and hope to people's lives. Religion isn't a scapegoat for one's shortcomings and it isn't an escape from reality. Some of us just care a lot about our spiritual lives and it's hard to decide whether we care about the spiritual or physical side of things. It isn't an easy task to disregard religion, so it makes sense why OP is having a hard time over this. Religion is just something we value and trust in a lot. Having a lot of trust in something usually leads to obedience. I know it sounds hypocritical of me to say that, but I'm still a growing Christian (fairly new to be honest) and I'm learning how to trust in God more so that I can be obedient. Practicing obedience also means that you have the patience for God's rewards. And these rewards may not necessarily manifest physically. I know that y'all don't agree, and that's totally fine. It's hard for Christians to fully agree with the Bible too. 
ANYWAYS, I don't want this to turn into a religious debate or whatever, I just couldn't silently read some of the comments on the original post. Like hey, practicing sexual abstinence doesn't mean you're ugly or that you lack social skills, it just means you got a lot of willpower for the Lord lol. It's not that hard to find a hookup nowadays. Also, I think that a lot of the girls on campus are pretty in some way, so yea that Triton eye comment was pretty mean.",,,,Fri,26.0,26.0,98.55999999999953,150.92000000000087,186.5600000000008,0.099,0.686,0.216,0.9981,04

Honestly, I don't know if I have a right to be upset, because it's natural for people joke around a lot. It's just that I don't feel like we're that close, and I don't insult them back. It's also confusing because they occasionally do nice things for me (such as share notes or get food together), but then for the next few days they make a big deal about how nice they are.
They've said things like ""are you so dumb that you have to take notes about XXX topic?"", ""Shut up and buy me food"", and ""Why'd you sit in my seat, you ruin everything."" In class, they'll use my desk as personal storage for their items, talk frequently, poke me/grab my hand while I'm writing, write on my notebook, and physically take away my notebook.

It‚Äôs happened to me in high school with my ex-bestfriend and now my roommate.

Now I don‚Äôt particularly think I‚Äôm superior than others nor am I conceited, but I am aware I was blessed with certain things. I‚Äôm tired of my roommate constantly attacking me for things I work hard for.

In comparison to my roommate I am skinnier (she‚Äôs extremely insecure about herself being overweight), taller, in a happy relationship, have a higher GPA, and I guess prettier by societal standards. Everything besides height I work towards. I wake up at 6AM to work out and spend most of my time studying. She on the other hand sleeps until 1pm and plays video games all the time. Yet she has the audacity to complain about being fat when she has all the time in the world to work on herself. I offered to go to the gym with her and she refuses like what the heck?? 

I‚Äôm so sick of her constant complaining and bullying. However, I don‚Äôt think we are able to sit down and talk because I know she won‚Äôt listen, especially if I take charge. If I do anything that‚Äôs leadership-like she immediately dejects me. I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore, how come I‚Äôm getting attacked for being good to myself smh.

So she and I have taken several classes together (and may very probably be taking more in future), plus we have worked and are also currently working together in larger groups on academic and/or outside-the-class projects for over a year now. We've also been chatting and texting each other a lot about a variety of academic and non-academic things. 

Here's my confusions with the ""shooting your shot"":

I don't know how she'll react if I ""shoot my shot"", especially considering that we've been working together for a while and I don't wanna jeopardize my work. Even if I ""confess feelings"" for her, I don't know what to do next: a relationship, keep things as it is, or something else .. ? I am relatively flexible with where she wants to take things, but I also think that both of us are extremely busy people and may not have the time to take things forward either. I guess, I just want to let her know that she's perfect, while being almost completely okay with keeping things almost the same as right now. I won't be able to see her (only texting at the most) during the summer. Idk how to flirt or anything and don't even intend to do it that much; haven't even asked out anyone before. Would still like to be atleast a great friend, though. To make matters even more complicated, she's an Indian American but I am an Indian (*cough* social and cultural constraints on both sides actually)

Hard to totally ignore as the feeling fluctuates. Also been trying hard to look for social cues from her, but it seems pretty mixed-up imo. Unable to share this with anyone either. Been thinking for several months to make this post and been thinking for even more time to talk to her about this. Could probably just still keep everything bottled-up inside me (as I have for almost a year now) and just be thankful that amazing people like her are a part of my life in the first place, but Idk if thats the best option to choose either.

The comments I've read on that post were a bit concerning to me and I would like to address them. I'd do it under my account but no need to draw negative attention to myself.

1) I think we can all agree that she should have disclosed her status to me. If you disagree then go take a hike.

2) To Page Groeling: I am very much aware that herpes does not place my life in danger. However it is still a non lethal threat. I don't want to deal with rashes or cold sores if I can easily avoid it. To clarify I meant I was placed in danger of unnecessarily contracting a life long discomfort. Yes, there are treatments to make it easier to deal with. Why should I have to subject myself to that because of some asshole I barely know?

3) To Isaac Jiali Bi and those who were out to provide education: I'll review some of the statistics given by you all. ""Herpes is extremely common, 67% of adults have it globally."" ""~90% of people have type 1 and/or type 2"" ""About one in eight people ages 14-49 in the United States have genital HSV-2 infection."" ""1 in 5 men have it and 1 in 4 women have it."" 

Although I appreciate your attempts to provide education literally none of you agree with each other on statistics.

Furthermore how are these statistics supposed to help me? My case is a very specific situation where my partner has a 100% chance of having type 1 herpes that spread to her vagina.

4) If made aware of my partner's status earlier would I have had sex with her? No. The  comments shaming me for this decision are uncalled for. We live in a society where we are trying to move towards women feeling comfortable rejecting sex in any situation possible and having their partner being okay with this. I'm in full support of this mindset. As such I also deserve the right to only consent to sexual situations I am comfortable with. Some people may have the preference to have sex with someone who is knowingly positive for herpes. I choose differently. This is not a decision that is up for debate because a decision to withhold consent is not debatable.

5) To Travis Gilbert and –ò–¥–∞ –•–∞—á–∞—Ç—É—Ä—è–Ω—Ü: You two voiced many of my thoughts and feelings on this. I completely agree with everything you said. Thank you for standing up for me.

6) The fact that I feel I need to defend myself not wanting to contract and deal with an STD is outrageous. Is it possible and normal to live a healthy life with herpes? Yes.

It‚Äôs happened to me with my ex-best friend in highschool and now with my roommate. Basically the two have the same personality: to put others down if they feel like they are inferior to them. I‚Äôm really sick of her bullying and mistreatment, but it‚Äôs her way of dealing with her insecurities. Now I‚Äôm not a conceited person, but I am aware I was just blessed with a lot of good things. I rarely brag about anything, I only do if it‚Äôs something I‚Äôm genuinely proud of, like getting a 100% on a midterm, not with the intention to make others feel bad.

Compared to my roommate I am skinny (she‚Äôs really conscious about herself being overweight), taller (she pretty much has a Napoleon complex), in a happy relationship (she‚Äôs had a history of bad ones), have a higher GPA, and I guess prettier if we are basing off of society‚Äôs views of physical beauty. All of these things besides height I work towards. I wake up at 6AM to go to the gym and spend a lot of time studying. However she barely puts in any work into herself and ends up complaining.

Some of them have better GPAs, some of them are in great relationships, some of them are leaders in student orgs, and so on.

I mean I won't blame them for not caring about a trash guy like me, and honestly it would be better if I just disappeared. There's also the issue of them telling to do this and do that, you know, the positivity and exploration argument that everyone's heard of, but they just don't work on a person like me who doesn't have the motivation for any of that.

I ignored that and hoped maybe things would be different if I went to the GBM. Nope same thing. I thought okay it's because I am an introvert and just don't vibe with these people. that's okay.

I tried joining another org (which I've realized that it's a good thing I didn't join not gonna call peoples directly out cause that aint cool) and that didn't go so well. I showed up to an event where they were having free food and I went around 30 mins after it started and people were still eating and talking, and I was told oh the events over and that was pretty much it. The food wasn't even the main reason I showed up like actually the org was full of people who I thought I was gonna really vibe with but again guess not. 

Then I found KOTX with my friend. The people were friendly at the booth. That was a good start. Went to a GBM and they were really fun. I was with my friend that time, but she couldn't go to their next event but I wanted to go cause I thought this org would be the one. So, me being the introverted and anti-social af person I am, was surprised that I went to their bonfire. And even more shockingly was warmly welcomed and even met some of my close friends there. I went from knowing no one to literally spending 75% of my time with all of these people. I'm still shocked cause nani the fuck im so awkward and introverted its gross

So maybe I truly didn't vibe with other groups, but it definitely isn't because I'm introverted. KOTX may not be for everyone, but give it more than one chance imo. In my experience, KOTX isn't as clique or clicky(?) (idk how to spell) as many make it out to be. It's definitely not the cliquest org out there.

I have trouble falling into a deep sleep and usually can't fall asleep until 3 at the very earliest, an issue which probably doesn't help low moods (likely related, though.) For a while, depression and burnout from life in general had kind of taken away my ability to feel sad. Self-loathing bred passive resignation, particularly in regards to whether I was capable of being loved or receiving affection. Now, though, matters of love are playing a part in my becoming reacquainted with sadness. When I see people in relationships, I yearn for the little things. My suite-mate and their SO brush their teeth together, often laughing alongside each other. I don't want to admit it, but my heart kind of hurts when I see it. It's not a feeling of resentment, just a sense of sorrow about not sharing that bond with another person. I don't care about holding hands for appearances sake (showing someone off to aid my ego), but I yearn for the feeling of knowing someone who would see my hand as one worth holding. Trying to do little things to put myself out there, but I don't know how to not look distressed. I cherish my friends and like what I do, so I have other sources of refuge to help me as I work through a lot of underlying issues at least.

They broke up and our friendship became closer but while I knew that her character (like ambition or empathy levels) wasnt the best fit to mine (I would care too much she would care too little about things; I loved to try new things she hated doing that stuff) our hobbies and everything else matched and we've had lots of fun times and laughed together. When we first met we had an almost fwb start; we didnt have sex or anything but I've felt up her boobs and she's touched my dick and we enjoyed cuddling a lot. Then we stopped once she got a boyfriend but we still maintained our friendship. I feel that now that I've known her for so long, I've grown past the lust part of our friendship and love her wholeheartedly. Sometimes though, when she talks about getting another boyfriend, I catch myself thinking ""I can be your ideal boyfriend."" But realistically I know that our relationship wouldnt last because our personalities are so different and I'm also scared to tell her because I dont want to ruin what we have; it's gotten me through a lot and she's really been a beacon of support, despite how many times I have to bother her to try going out her comfort zone or to even help me with a chore here or there. It's tough because other than the personality clashes, she's my ideal type and I just love *her*. I love her smile and how her eyes light up; how elegant she looks when she crosses her legs. I love how she can be totally wacky and say some really random things sometimes and how we can laugh about the weirdest stuff together. But I know if we were to get into a relationship I've friendzoned myself so hard at this point that it's would be completely one-sided. I used to see her message her boyfriend all thr time and she would be sending him pictures and videos and messaging him all the time. I dont think she would go as far for me.

There are a lot of great clubs on campus that students can involve themselves where they can grow in their field and become a part of a community but the biggest problem is that not many people know about them. Why?
   
Because it takes a lot of effort and talent to actually make good flyers to catch people's attention but members, let's say in a specific engineering club, won't necessarily have the spare time or Photoshop/editing skills to get in done nicely.   

That's why I want to propose a program which UCSD should start where students who are majoring in Visual Arts and have experience in media, photography, and graphic design etc. can join these clubs specifically for the purpose of designing  and managing these recruitment materials (flyers, website, facebook page) in exchange for 1 unit of credit per quarter. 

It's a win/win situation because these students can build up their portfolio, gain experience working with teams and get credit to graduate, while the club gets an established on-campus and online presence.

A short time ago, I fell fairly hard for this lady who I see precisely twice a week for a total of four hours per week. She is a (very senior) member of the club I am in and I never ever see her anywhere outside of club meetings ever. We never really talk during the club meetings because most of the biweekly two hour meetings are devoted to club business and because she typically walks in late and/or leaves immediately after the meetings end. And when we do have free time before/during/after the meetings themselves, I never really have an opportunity to engage her because she's typically engaged with all of the other senior club people (since they're all really close friends outside of the club) and it would just be horribly awkward and rude if I cut off or butted into their conversation. We share no classes together, nor do we ever bump into each other on campus, so there's never really been a chance for spontaneous conversation to occur. I've never been particularly concerned about initiating and maintaining the conversation, since I'm a pretty good conversationalist and so is she (from what I can infer) and we both have fairly similar interests (more similar than practically all my previous crushes). We're also connected to one another on Messenger and Instagram, but I sense I wouldn't have much success by going the inbox route, since she is busy ad perpetuum (coursework, club work, and work work too, I'd presume). Also I haven't the slightest clue about where I'd even begin, how I'd initiate conversation online considering we still don't know each other very well (although luckily we aren't strangers). At this point, I don't know what to do. I feel like I've reached my wit's end. It's gotten to the point where I am beginning to fervently hope/pray for some kind of break, anything at all, any chance encounter or opportunity anywhere. I understand that things like this happen and them's the breaks, but it's still so incredibly frustrating. Irrespective of what happens though, I'm still gonna shoot my shot, since I haven't a thing to lose by doing so. And I understand that irrespective of how much foundation I build up between her and myself, she may still shoot me down for reasons that are totally beyond my control (or alternatively, she may accept simply out of interest). It's just that I want to reduce the probability of being shot down (however great that may be) as much as possible (however much that amount may be).

There's a reason interviews and essays exist; every individual is a unique human being that has capacity to contribute, and no amount of grades or test scores can hamper that.

Recently, I'm particularly interested in one guy who is pretty new to tinder. The first time we met, we got to know each other, and I was a little surprised to hear that he didn't have that much experience with sex. Like Idk, he's a solid 8 or 9 and he's a whole foot taller than me. Anyways, after we had sex, he told me that he really liked being with me and that he didn't want to just leave right after because he didn't want me to feel used. When he said those words, it really made me happy because I just want a relationship with some substance. Of course, it's too soon to say that we'll turn into something serious, but him saying that gave me a lil hope. 
He's also super affectionate, and I kinda forgot how much I liked hugs and soft pecks until he came along. Actually, I tend to be uncomfortable/tense around new people, but I feel very comfortable with him physically. Like his embrace is just very comforting and addictive. SO the combination of the fact that we vibe pretty well, his particularly pleasant affection, and his somewhat wholesome intentions has got me pretty hooked. 
3 or 4 days after we meet, he hits me up first and we end up talking and cuddling for a few hours. He tells me that he got out of a relationship before spring break, and he kinda told me that he didn't think we were anything serious. Idk if he meant that he didn't want to, but yea it was a little discouraging ngl. BUT I can understand why he's more hesitant to jump into something. He did share that he just hated being lonely, so I think we're on the same page in that sense. After that, we rambled on about other stuff, and he started to get sleepy. He really wanted me to stay the night, but I wasn't down because I had an 8 am. He told me again that he thinks that we get along really well for some reason. Before I left, he hugged me for a long time and told me that he liked being with me.
Since then, I can't get him out of my mind. Like damn I don't wanna be a sucker for words, but now I smile whenever I think about him. Despite all that sweet stuff, I am also trying to not be invested in case he loses interest and finds another girl. This has happened to me two or three times, so I'm just worried that this is gonna be that same situation. I want to keep seeing him, but I'm feeling insecure about us as well.

She always tries to be the center of attention, never apologizes even though she knows shes in the wrong, tries to victimize herself in every situation as to seem that she didn't do anything wrong, and all around fake. She would also have a different problem everyweek and would be in a depressed mood, we would try to help her out but she literally had a new problem each week so we just grew tired of trying to even help her, seeing as though she rarely listen to our advices or is even appreciative of it. Its not just me either, some of our other friends that knows about the situation also have started to dislike her, but those that doesn't know still adore her and doesn't think anything wrong of her. I dont want to ruin their image of her because I don't think its my place to tell them what to think of a person but I also think its unfair that they hold her on this pedestal and believe her to be this great person.

I don't really know what to do. I know that she has some mental issues (depression, suicidal thoughts) and by pushing her away more I feel like it might get worse for her. Like I said, some of our mutual friends have also distanced themselves from her too so she doesn't have the support system that she used to have but also I don't want to be fake. I don't want to pretend that I'm there for her when I'm not anymore or that everything is fine and dandy. We already rarely talk anyways even though we share the same room, but I still have a whole quarter to live with her and it just seems my home has become an unwelcoming environment.

Unrelated to why I dislike her now, but I think she might be gay. She had this weird fascination with one of our girl friend (which i think she liked) and ever since our friend got a boyfriend she started acting worse.

Fuck you and your dumb snapchats about our history. I know you too well and I know every post is about me I know because I used to do the same... but you know what I grew up. 
I got over my issues of relationships and trust and started to let you in. It was going okay and then you stopped fighting right after I stepped in the ring. 

You were my best friend and maybe you knew it or maybe not but you were when I was happiest and even if my fear took over and I moved on you never gave up.    Even after you moved 3000 miles away thats when it was strongest. And no I couldnt do long distance even if we only saw each other a few times that summer you still loved me and that became my anchor.

No i couldnt say it back quite yet but I did eventually and things went slow, you went to school closer to me but still a few states away but it was always enough to keep me holding on. Sometimes the thought of you was the only thing I had because it was a constant like pi or the speed of light. 

And no we were not in a relationship but I couldnt date anyone else and you knew that and I knew you wouldnt. But you didnt trust me did you you never asked?  

If youve gotten this far there were a lot of nos above but a lot of yeses as well a lot of memories - and then you stopped, the letters that warmed my heart and the phone calls I waited for every night. So when finals got me busy and I was feeling down and I couldnt talk to you and you broke it off and cut me out you cannot weep and pull me back with your pathetic excuse for a message over your snapchat story. Have you tried to call me? Explain things? No instead you cant understand how heart broken and plain broken I am

Reading rooms and cues is something that I have to constantly practice, so I veer towards over-analysis and being cautious as a general rule of thumb. This keeps me out of sticky situations, but it also deters me from taking potentially positive risks. I have some great friends, but my circle is relatively limited and I am not one to put myself out there. After getting past the mental hurdle of telling someone else that I have feelings for them (didn't work out and that's okay), I have found myself feeling noticeably more attracted to people in general and it's really confusing. My game-spitting skills are non-existent. I can't tell when or if someone is sending me signals and miss on potential opportunities to spark up conversations or flirt a bit. For example, a person smiled at me and said they recognized me from a class before asking me about how the final went, leading to a brief convo. They were really enthusiastic and I appreciated someone initiating a convo as simple as that, but I still came off as really shy throughout the interaction. Another time, someone poked me on the back to compliment me on something I was wearing and I said ""thank you"" with a smile before continuing to go about what I was doing. 

I am not particularly bad looking for someone so socially inept, but I worry that the combination of my shyness and my features make me look almost childlike. I feel like some people might read my shyness as an indicator of being asexual or aromantic, a feeling that only gets compounded when I tell them that I am on the spectrum. I recently created a tinder profile as a ""fuck it"" move, but I don't have any matches yet. My settings (within general campus/student life radius so it isn't all randos) may be contributing a bit, but it would suck if it's just that I am not drawing interest or am not cognizant of unreasonable standards that I might have.

2.) When a lecture hall is full and there are people sitting on the stairs, you shouldn't save seats. ""first come, first serve"" doesn't apply when there is a 10 minute window from the previous lecture for all students to find a seat. 

3.) Do not enter a lecture hall, until the previous lecture is 80% vacated. As much as your passion to learn is admirable, it's absolutely rude to shove your way into a FULL lecture hall. Form a line or group away from the exits of the lecture hall so students can leave safely and efficiently.

10822,2019-04-03 01:54:47,"Hey, so there have been recent posts about fat people. I really don't take offense to these post because I know I'm fat and would never consider myself curvy. I do believe that America's body positivity has taken a turn where obesity should be accepted but it kinda shouldn't. Being obese fucking sucks, not for looks (you are beautiful), but for health. I had a diabetes scare that really put shit into perspective. I know I can make myself beautiful with the right clothes and makeup but that will not make up for the fact that my health is in decline. 

However, there is a reason on how I got myself to be this. During middle school I was actually an average weight but I got depressed and found comfort in food when I couldn't it find in others. It took me awhile to just accept the fact that I'm fat. 

The type of ""harsh"" comment was made but it won't actually do anything. Only skinny people would agree with you (with the exception of me) and others would go agaisnt you. Fat people may call themselves curvy in order to cover the blow of being fat, but it is better promote workouts and diets than degrading fat people.

Degrading people just makes the people hate you and go against you. 

If I'm going to kill myself due to obesity at least let me die peacefully.

So I have these two really close friends and we‚Äôve known each other for about a three years (?). We‚Äôre about 21/22 years old but I‚Äôve been having communication issues with the both of them. 

So I‚Äôm from LA and I recently moved to San Diego to attend university so I understand that it was inevitable that we would communicate less

With one of the friends, I understand why I get slow responses from her Bc she has work and school and a bf etc etc so we generally talk at the end of the day or sometimes about once a week and it‚Äôs great. 

The other friend however, I just feel like he‚Äôs never there anymore? And he‚Äôs by no means ‚Äòbusy‚Äô whatsoever. Yes, he does attend school but that‚Äôs simply it. Of course whatever classes he‚Äôs taking may be difficult for him and maybe that‚Äôs why he doesn‚Äôt message back until 12 hours later but I just don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs why. He also doesn‚Äôt go out much. If he was out with his friends, then I‚Äôm not expecting him to message me back soon all the time but i know that he rarely goes out. When he‚Äôs not at school, he‚Äôs at his house playing games/ procrastinating from homework. 

If I message him about something that‚Äôs annoying me from a certain professor (or something), I don‚Äôt hear from this friend for basically 10-12 hours. But when I have gossip or something about an ex or whatever, he messages back instantly. 

I‚Äôm definitely not asking for him to be messaging me back instantly all the time. I mean even I can‚Äôt do that Bc I do have classes and exams but idek. I know in general he spends a lot of time on his phone A LOT, so I know he‚Äôs getting my messages and just choosing not to message back. 

It doesn‚Äôt help that when he wants to text me about help on his homework or something that‚Äôs going on in his life, he‚Äôll spam my phone and then call me if I don‚Äôt respond right away. 

One time, he spammed my phone about fifteen minutes before I was about to take a final to ask for homework help and when I wasn‚Äôt responding, he called and wouldn‚Äôt let me hang up until I helped him. And his assignment was going to be due in two hours, so it also makes me angry that he sees me as a person who needs to be at his ‚Äòservice‚Äô because of his poor time management, yet he can‚Äôt be there for me when I‚Äôm feeling upset or excited about something (which is also super rare, I‚Äôm not one to be complaining about everything or gush about everything. I usually take some time to think about things and contemplate whether or not, it‚Äôs worth my time to be upset/ excited). 

It‚Äôs just that recently I feel like when I‚Äôm feeling super excited about something or super upset about something, I don‚Äôt really have people to turn to anymore. ITs different to tell a story 12 hours later because the peak of my emotion (whether it be excitement or anger) is gone. It just simply becomes a story.

10668,2019-04-01 01:41:26,"This is not a confession, but some advice I'd like to post for graduating seniors or anyone looking for a job, internship, etc.  I'd like to post it anonymously so that it doesn't seem like I'm bragging.  I keep seeing post about people applying to 30+ jobs and not getting interviews.  Honestly, that's likely your problem.  You need to be spending hours customizing each application so that it's clear that you don't just want a job, but you want that particular job with that company.  Show interest in the company and show why the company is not only a good fit for you, but why you're a good fit for them.  If you send in generic resumes/cover letters, then it's going to seem like you are just looking for money and will likely leave the company if given a better offer.  Depending on where you are applying, you may want to drop off resumes in person (especially if you are looking for a job where you would be working with customers).  Always look professional and ask to speak to a manager when dropping off the resume/cover letter.  When working over the summer, I got interviews at places I was nowhere near qualified to work.  Why?- because I had a good handshake, showed up in a suit, and showed interest in the company.  Smile too!  Too often I see people showing up to interviews in jean/without their shirts tucked in.  I graduated last year and got a job offer in the fall for $80/hour.  After being offered the position, I told the company that I'd have to think about it since I still wanted to look into other companies.  They then offered me $85.  (FYI I had no internships and only graduated with a 2.9 GPA).  Know your worth.  Play up your strengths and quantify your abilities on your resume if possible.  Also, study for your interviews!  If you can't do the harder problems, buy a book a study!  Chemists/biochemists- you should be able to make buffers!  CS majors- get a book of problems and work through them.  They will ask you similar problems.  There's only so many ways to solve these and you need to find the most efficient way.  Do practice interviews and study for your interviews like you studied for your tests.  Even better, study with friends.  If you're still struggling, consider working with a recruiter who can help prep you for interviews.  Always thank your interviewers for their time and be excited about the interviews/position.  Have your ""elevator pitch"" prepared and research the company.  Coming with questions/showing your knowledge about the company will show your interest. Spell check everything you send and have someone who knows your strengths look over it.  If you know someone good at grammar, ask him to read through your cover letter/resume.  Limit your resume to 1 page and use strong verbs on your resume.  Make sure you referrals know that you'll be using them as referrals (so that they can plan to say some nice things about you).  Don't lie on your resume! 
 If there's a skill you think you need, learn it!  Some applications will require skills that no one has (like 10 years experience with a language that's been around for 9), so still apply even if you don't meet every requirement.   Also, quantify/qualify your experience/skills (X years experience, proficient vs. advanced, etc.)   Lastly, have a professional e-mail address.  If your e-mail address is something like ""babyboi420@_________.com"", then your resume is going to be trashed right away.  Be confident and good luck everyone! :)",,advice,,Mon,32.0,10.0,174.03400000000008,84.63000000000011,135.19100000000026,0.076,0.754,0.17,0.9963,01

But I was put inside a suite that is half international students and the rest seems like they all have their socially awkwardly problems. They get along fine, but I just don't fit in with them. Some of them talk about history and philosophy, and I don't have the knowledge of this kind of stuff to get into the conversation, while others just come out at night to play this one game religiously at night. 
I've tried some clubs, but I feel so separated in the events and meetings. I know you are suppose to like approach people, but I don't know why people come up to me. I went to one bonfire in the first quarter and I just ended up staring out at the ocean alone for 2 hours until the bonfire ended. 
My high school friends told me I had to take initiative, but its hard when you're scared of what to say. And its so much easier for other people because they go into those clubs with other people so they feel more comfortable.
When I was hanging out with my friends over break, I told them of my problem but they say I have so much potential and i'm a good-looking guy and that I shouldn't be scared, and people would love me. During that hangout I saw someone I thought looked like my old friend from my Sunday school and she was glancing at me too. She was really pretty, but I didn't want to talk to her. But my friend went over there and asked and then dragged me over there and when I was talking to her, she seemed flustered and kept on turning to her friend and giggling? but I felt so uncomfortable despite the one asking questions and in the end I just left and I hated myself. This is the perfect example of how I envision being the one making the first move in a conversation.

My boyfriend and I recently dropped some acid after finals week to celebrate and had a pretty good time up until we decided to add some edibles to the mix. 

When the edibles hit during my trip, it felt like time itself slowed down, as well as my perception of sound. Everything looked like it was melting, almost like that one Salvador Dali painting with the clocks. When I turned to my boyfriend for help, he looked really distorted, like when Windows XP did that weird windows lag glitch. That spooked me the fuck out, along with distorted, slowed sounds and visuals ended up putting me into a scary thought loop, and eventually a horrific trip. 

During the bad trip I somehow convinced myself that my whole life was a lie and everything was fabricated by some higher being as some kind of sick joke. For 4-6 hours it felt as if I were stuck in purgatory, having repeated deja vus about finding out my life was a lie. I thought I was going to lose my mind. (tbh the experience felt like that one Naruto episode when Itachi puts Kabuto under Izanami lol)

 I think the worst part of this trip was when I thought my boyfriend and my relationship of 5 years was just a figment of my imagination. The sad thing was that I didn't want to believe that I could have possibly made this relationship up and come to terms with it. Because just the thought/idea of my boyfriend made me so happy I was willing to live and uphold that lie. 

ngl after the whole ordeal we sad and happy cried for a good hour together 

moral of the story is don't mix drugs and love your SO until just the thought of them makes you smile like an idiot <3

It‚Äôs super difficult for me to make friends because I‚Äôm super quiet/introverted/socially awkward. I want to make more friends but idk how too.

I feel super depressed and I drink a bunch of alcohol and I started doing drugs to cheer me up about my crappy life. I really want to commit suicide and I attempted it like 2 years ago, maybe nows the time :( I just feel so down and out and people say ‚ÄúIt‚Äôll get better‚Äù  or ‚Äúyou‚Äôll get through this‚Äù but I feel thats bs. I just don‚Äôt have the will to continue and my grades have suffered significantly. My gpa is below 2.0 and that makes me even more depressed/sad. Im not motivated and I miss most of my classes. People also make fun of me. Like when literally anyone talks to me, I just cheer up and it makes my day. Like I got hugged from a friend and I got teary. When I see people happy, I get kinda sad because I know I‚Äôm missing out. I‚Äôm also fairly insecure. I have family issue but its not super bad but still an issue that stresses me out.

10549,2019-03-25 22:25:04,"A lot on my mind so I'm just going to dump out everything I'm thinking as of this break. It's been a few years since my ex and I had parted ways, and pretty much all of the feelings have gone away now. Time really does heal, and so does getting away from their social media to not be reminded of them. Even though I don't have them on anything anymore I still feel that I care about them, but having them keep contact is too much of a burden for what it's currently worth. Sometimes I wonder how they're doing and if life has been good to them, and sometimes when I'm down I wish they had it worse than me. Regardless of what goes on I still think in my heart that they were a wonderful person during our relationship and that I wish they find happiness in what they do wherever they go. Despite our mistakes we made in high school and college I still treasure them as much as I did when we spent time together, even though I haven't talked to her in years. Recently I have been meeting new people in my clubs and other orgs too, and I think they're nice people, but it doesn't feel as warm as my first one did. I don't think I'm cut out for relationships; I feel enough fulfillment making friends that I couldn't make before. Anytime someone asks me about dating I just tell them I'm interested in someone as a placeholder.

As for my own life, as the end of my college career nears I feel more and more pressure from my family to find an internship and eventually a job. I feel as though I was never mentally prepared during admissions season in high school and if I could go back in time to replace my freshman self with me, I would save a lot of headache and disappointment to my parents. From sophomore to junior year in high school a lot of people need to make a decision that would impact how the rest of their life would play out. I wasn't ready to make such a decision then and I feel like now I'm regretting my path I've walked. A part of me tells me to get into a stable job with good security, and another part says follow a ""dream"" that could shatter as soon as my drive and ambitions do. I'm much too afraid to tell my parents that I regret my decisions, yet I still want to do my best in classes and fear failure and rejection. I'm at that point in life where many of my friends, just like many others, are going through different phases in life; getting married, getting internships/jobs, travelling the world, etc. While the only thing I've done is go to class, clubs, and a few places to travel with family. I have this unconscious benchmark of my friends' lives compared to mine and if I'm falling behind, I get scared. There are times where I wish I had the mental capacity and discipline that my friends do to go out and succeed, and live fulfilling lives. And then sometimes I wish that my parents didn't push me to go into a path that compensates satisfaction and mental well-being for stability and a good salary just to brag to family and friends during get-togethers. 

Despite all of this, I don't think I would think about committing suicide. There's still things I want to do in life, even though I feel as if I'm dragging my feet. I'm thankful for all the people I've met so far and the experiences I've gained. My one and only relationship that lasted through high school to college, although ending somewhat sourly, was something I wouldn't trade for the world. I still want to prove to my parents that I can be on my own and that coming to America wasn't in vain. I want to be a person that is successful enough to tell my kids that they can choose a path in life that they want without worry for financial problems because of my old past and parents' upbringing. I don't want to let anyone down.

The color of my love for him is light blue, as opposed to magenta for my boyfriend. This all might sound strange, but I just want to tell everyone! I'm so happy.

I didn't think much of it at the time, as I was really just a sad CS student failing your class ranting on the internet, but I feel terrible now for berating you so mercilessly. Here's my honest opinion of you: You teach incredibly well: I actually understand everything from CSE 20 because of your lectures. You are super funny: I really like your jokes. Your tests are not that hard: I was just sleepy and not focused. You teach class too early and do not cover the homework material sufficiently in class.

Overall bach, I am sorry for using such profane words to describe you. I hope you did not take it personally, for I was just a sad CS student failing your class. However, going to every single office hour session after failing the second midterm saved me, and I can candidly tell you that I liked the class and am excited to take you again next quarter for CSE 21. I have no other choice to take your 8am lecture, I wish you would teach another time, but I am excited to learn more from you in 21.

i'm part southeast asian, part other asian that I won't mention because that would probably easily identify me to my friends, a fourth year STEM major guy, and pretty sure i'm trans and want to be a girl. i've never felt complacent being manly or a guy. for the last year and a half, and especially the last few months my dysphoria acts up a lot. 

last summer one of my friends took me shopping since I told her I really wanted to try on a dress. when i tried it on and took pictures, I felt super happy. it was one of my best days of my life. i look at the pictures occasionally to make myself feel a little better if i'm feeling particularly dysphoric. in addition i'm hanging out with a few girls this week for a study session, and in the group chat the one girl i've told i'm trans to (jokingly) to the others said that I was a part of the girl's club. i smile a little bit whenever I look at that message, because I knew she knew and wanted to make me happy.

it's still hard though. trans asian-american females, and southeast asian ones at that (and STEM!) are a very small minority and I feel lonely most of the time. i've told a few friends, and they've been super nice to me about it, but i never know where to go. i'm not really out yet, and i've tried taking so many trips to the mall by myself to go buy a dress or skirt but stop in front of the store and fail because i'm scared. I also don't really vibe much with the other people at the lgbt center sadly. reddit as a space isn't much better. most if not all pictures of trans individuals there are white, so where I do I fit in?  

the worst part is that i always think that this part of me, this desire to be someone that I cannot, is wrong and shouldn't be. I don't like that to be who I want to look like and feel i might have to physically through hormones modify my body or go through years of voice feminization practice. 
why couldn't I have been just born a girl?
if i tried telling my parents this, i'm afraid of the family cutoff. I'm bi as well, but it feels much scarier trying to tell an asian family as a boy you want to be a girl rather than telling them you like other boys. 
I also really like my extended family from the two asian cultures I come from. i'm lucky enough I get to visit them in the two home countries a lot, but i'm scared of blowback, because losing the chance to connect with them feels like losing a part of myself. and when i'm already struggling with my gender identity, why not let the cultural one be lost along the way? 
i'm basically avoiding studying for finals, as you can tell. i'll probably try one day this week to go to the mall and see if I can work up the courage to buy a skirt or something. i love gender dysphoria <3

3 years ago, my ex broke up with me (i didn't want to). About a month after, one of his friends who I used to like before dating my ex started casually flirting with me, and kinda trying to get my ex completely out of my head i flirted back, although this lasted like a week at most. I knew the guy and my ex got along well, but had no idea to what extent their friendship went, and from what I still know he's just the kind of ""friend"" who's more than an acquaintance but less than a best friend or actual friend. To put this into perspective, they never engage in a conversation unless they're in the same place, where they friendly greet each other and start talking non stop (this is as much as I know about them). Anyways, he left for college and 4 months later came back and asked me out. At this point, my ex and I weren't talking, I asked for no contact when we broke up and I really wasn't interested in having a friendship with him, only being in ""friendly terms"" but we agreed I would message him whenever I wanted this to happen. So I went out with this guy, and ended up sleeping with him. He was my first and not my ex, because I didn't feel ready with my body while I was with my ex but I felt comfortable one year later and wanted to try. We started a fwb type of thing, although I later found out myself he was kind of my rebound to try and stop loving my ex. Stuff happened between this guy and I, and we stopped talking. Somewhere between this, I messaged my ex back because I felt I had ""already forgotten about him"" and was ready to just be on friendly terms. This was roughly 6 months after the breakup. Fast forward 6 more months, and after not seeing him for a year we met up (he wanted to know how I was doing) and I realized i still cared for him. Fast forward 4 more months and I travelled to the US from my home country, he came to visit me for a weekend, so did i, and we hooked up. This is when I knew I still had lingering feelings for him. Fast forward 6 months and he invites me to stay over at his apt. We hook up again, we cuddle and this is when I realized I actually still love him. We're still hooking up, and we've both confessed we still have feelings for each other. It took me this long to realize I want him back, and he's the reason I am never satisfied with any guys I try to date. However, the more I realized he DID matter to me, the worse I felt about sleeping with someone he knew. I want him back, i love him and only him but I can't bear to make a move feeling this guilty, and I don't know why if 1) we were broken up, 2) i didn't know and still don't know if their friendship goes beyond a friendly exchange of words at certain meetings once a year plus didn't care since I wasn't talking to my ex and 3)  i didn't even want to get back with him at that point, in fact I wanted him out of my life as much as I possibly could, so I couldn't love him ever again.

10143,2019-03-14 05:30:20,"I've been told that I should write down my thoughts and what goes on in my mind instead of going to therapy. I am only writing this to see other people's thoughts of what is going on in my head. Please don't write things like ""hmu OP."" I'm not here to try to make myself feel better or something. I don't know. If I seem like a kid that doesn't appreciate what he has, I am sorry. I try to be as grateful as I can, especially to my family. They try to give me a better future in their own way. This was just what I wrote in an hour when left to myself for an hour.

Some backstory. I'm just your average kiddo trying his best. My dad left to America when I was six to work and  I lived with my mom my entire until I came to live with my Dad for high school. I have always been told to do my work now and good things will eventually come. I'm still waiting for them to come. I have been suicidal for too many years that I can't count anymore. Or maybe not. Is it normal to think about killing yourself? I've only ever seriously tried to commit suicide three times and that was when I was much younger. The other times I pussyed out. I don't think I'll commit suicide anymore either. I've spent most my life saying, I've already toughed this much out, might as well wait for good times. Anyways, the rest of this is kind of long and just my thoughts. I tried to paragraph them the best I could, I hopped between topics that were on my mind so if it is hard to read, I'm sorry.

Your life is a joke. Your family are basically robots and they don't care about shit other than success. Asian culture is possibly the worst possible methodology of raising a child. Raising a kid and allowing him to pursue his passion is what is always preached but never used. I've actually had my parents straight up say they don't care what my passion is. It's like I'm not living my own life. I'm just walking down a pre-laid path, stumbling around until I die. I wonder what the suicide rates among asians are compared to the rest of the population. Is it really a tragedy when a student commits suicide? Is it really uncommon? There was already a student that committed suicide this fall quarter, but nobody addresses it. They just brush it under the rug and pretend like it has never happened. I didn‚Äôt even know until now. What kind of system does that? Is it a fault in our system that causes that? If i were to commit suicide, I feel as if I was determined, It would already be too late. I‚Äôm a stubborn guy haha. If i was like ‚ÄúThis is it and i will commit suicide‚Äù I would always be curious what kind of people are truly kind and true to themselves. As much as I criticize on my family for only being there for face value and never really showing others how they really feel, I honestly do the same. I feel as though I might be a sociopath or psychopath in that sense. I wonder if all my family is like that.

They never really show their emotions and they just do whatever it takes to better their own state. They don‚Äôt take into account other people and they will easily throw someone to the curb in order to better themselves. I feel as though they only do charity or seem kind so that they can front or tell themselves that they are genuinely good people. I do that too. I‚Äôm not a saint. I‚Äôm a major hypocrite. All my life I‚Äôve been wondering if I am a good person. Do good people really doubt whether they‚Äôre even nice? They just do it unconditionally. If I have to think ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to be a good person‚Äù, I can‚Äôt be a genuinely good person. I'm proud to say unlike my family that I feel sympathy though. I hold so much sympathy and patience for so many people. Except my family. I don't know why, but my patience runs thin with them and I get frustrated so easily by them now. Maybe its because my family is the only people who I get to see behind the curtains. I see them when they pretend to be nice. Laugh at other peoples jokes and then turn around and scoff at how they‚Äôre stupid. They‚Äôre lack of sympathy and empathy, projecting their anger on anyone even if they have nothing to do with anything.

I remember specifically this one time, my family was traveling and we took a taxi to a hotel that took a longer route just to make money. I understand it is scummy and hey they shouldn't have done that and taken advantage of us.I would be mad too. But since the taxi already left there wasn‚Äôt much we could do. Then my father went into the hotel and berated the woman who was working the front desk for what the taxi service has done. Why? That person had nothing to do with what they did. Why would you get worked up and mad at her specifically? They can‚Äôt do anything about it. I tried to calm him down and tell him to relax. What would yelling at them do. They aren't even responsible for what happened. And then he pushed me to the side and yelled at me. He said ‚ÄúTHIS DOES NOT INVOLVE YOU.‚Äù After he was done yelling at the clerk, he came over to me and said ‚ÄúSee? This is why you can‚Äôt let them take advantage of you. Never just get stepped on and always stand up for yourself.‚Äù Did you really think that was a valuable lesson? A teaching moment? All it let me know is that I can't believe in my family. They can't be my role models. They honestly aren‚Äôt anything like me. The dad that I have memories of, the one that I remember that had so much happiness and saw the world with so much love and care and sympathy, was very different then the real one I have. I guess it‚Äôs just the memory of a kid that's 6 years old that romanticize everything and sees people as perfect. But i don‚Äôt know. When I was younger I still knew my dad had anger issues. But it was Ok. Because he was still a  good person at heart right? 

My mom is a different story. I‚Äôm not sure what fond memory I have with her. All I remember is being forced to do things I didn't want. All I remember is getting beaten all the time. The memory that comes to me most is when I was in the corner and she punched me in the face and I fell on the ground. The memory is so muddled now and I can‚Äôt remember why she did it anymore. All I remember was the shock, pain, and sadness. Most of what is messed up with me I feel like is sourced from my mom. I actually think I might have been traumatized haha. My mom and my brother used my fear of the dark against me to make me do what they wanted. All I wanted to do was play with my friends and I understand that work needs to be done but I only got to work when I was younger. All those times locked in the garage and the basement. I still remember the fear and the hours I spent crying. I remember one time when I wanted to run away from home, and actually got the courage to do it. I left. And ran. Crying the entire time. Of course I couldn't even outrun my sister. She convinced me to come back. Her kindness is the only thing in my family. And when I came back the look on my moms face. Devoid of any sympathy. Just straight anger. Hilarious.

I'm not sure. Maybe I'm just lonely. I've tried to fill my life with things that might make me feel better. I've taken drugs before. I've surrounded myself with friends. But whenever I'm alone I always think like this. Nothing really gets better. Loneliness can't really be solved by anything.

10082,2019-03-12 15:51:54,"I had the purest, most wholesome relationship in the world. We developed a strong friendship at the age of 15, got together at 16, had our first kiss at 17 and lost our virginities to one another at 20. He wasn‚Äôt the best-looking guy and he was far from an ‚Äúalpha male‚Äù but he treated me like I was gold every single day of our relationship. I can honestly say that he had never hurt me. We had a great connection and had every intention to spend the rest of our lives together.

...Until I started wondering what else was out there. I looked around campus and saw other girls with these great-looking jock-types. I listened to stories of my friend as she hopped from the beds of player to player, making it sound as exciting as possible. Hook-up culture was rampant and hot guys were like trophies. When I saw girls at or below my smv pull alpha jock types, I started to stupidly wonder if I was ‚Äúselling myself short‚Äù. I‚Äôm ashamed to say that I actually began looking down on my poor boyfriend.

I broke up with him at 21, on summer break, simply stating that I felt like we had grown apart. Then fall quarter It didn‚Äôt take long for me to be approached by the most typical ‚Äúalpha‚Äù player jock that had ever lived. It‚Äôs actually hilarious how typical he was. Being hungry for what I felt like I‚Äôd been ‚Äúmissing out on‚Äù, I took him up on his offer and we became fwb. I knew it wouldn‚Äôt last- I‚Äôd heard all the stories and seen all the examples. But I decided that the experience was worth the potential outcome.

The potential outcome indeed happened. I found myself getting attached to him. Deeply. Just like the cliche goes, he didn‚Äôt feel the same (although he sure claimed to in order to keep me as a lay). He had an abundance of options, way too many to fall for lil‚Äô old me. I fell deeper and deeper as time went on to the point where I found it damn near impossible to let him go. I got badly hurt and embarrassed time and time again but whenever I tried to leave, he would pull me back, likely for the ego boost. It took him leaving the country for me to ‚Äúlet him go‚Äù.

Now,because of this fiasco, I feel dead inside. I can‚Äôt stand knowing that I left such a wonderful relationship for such a dumb reason. The most messed up part? My ex boyfriend told me that he still loved me and he forgave me for what I did. He was even open to getting back together. I couldn‚Äôt. I could no longer feel any kind of attraction to him anymore. In fact, I couldn‚Äôt feel it for anyone. Instead of having an n count of 1 (my potential husband), I now have a raised one. I can only see loneliness in my future; marriage is a far-fetched fantasy. This, I brought entirely on myself.

tldr; asked a question i wasnt ready to hear the answer to yet owo

So my boyfriend is coming home this wknd for his spring break, and since it's long-distance, we call every night. During my call tonight, he makes a joke about feet and I teasingly ask him if there are any other kinks he should warn me about. While I was the one to bring it up, I didn't really think it through, I just meant like other weird things that he's into, but now after talking I realize that.. . yeah kinks are sexually explicit. We hadn't brought any of this other stuff up before and I was just so shook,, this man was so straightforward with me (which I appreciate bc we love each other but nonetheless shook). Here I am planning to cuddle up with him, considering that I've literally only kissed him on the cheek, and he's waiting to see my thoughts on x-y-z. While yeah I would maybe want to try certain things and am willing to keep an open mind, I really want to keep it above the waist for the sake of the relationship,, bUt he's a spicy kind of guy. And so while he says he's fine with not doing certain things, I can't help but wonder if the passion will decrease on his end because there's other things that he's experienced and enjoys.

I would barely talk to people and I was the quiet girl who sat with a group of people who didn‚Äôt care enough to invite me to things. The very few decent friends I did have were sort of the outcasts in high school, which meant that I probably was too. I was sort of involved, but I wasn‚Äôt very good at what I did. Around senior year I felt like I was finally becoming more outgoing which helped. Anyway fast forward to college and I decided to do sorority recruitment. Now that I was in college, I felt like I could be my 100% self. I ended up in a well-respected sorority. Most of my sisters were clearly popular in high school, and the guys we hang out with in other frats looked like they were popular too. I feel like I still am still sort of obviously awkward and I feel like they would judge me if they knew what I was like in high school. And I feel like people in high school are probably shocked and confused now that I‚Äôm in a good sorority, and would even think I am living a lie. I know this probably sounds so stupid, but it‚Äôs something that‚Äôs been bothering me. I think I rushed to validate myself which makes me ashamed. I do really like the sorority I am in because the girls are genuine and chill, but I think if I was the same person I was in high school when I rushed, they would‚Äôve not invited me back.

It was 7:50 on a Sunday evening, and the dining halls closed at 8 on weekends. Using her athletic ability that came from being a dance major she sprinted down to Cafe V, and almost face--planted into the door which was being closed by a beautiful boi with a mop of windswept brown curls than she had the inexplicable urge to run her fingers through.

‚ÄúAnything?‚Äù he asked with a sexy smirk.
 ‚ÄúI think I can whip that up.‚Äù (Y/N) thanked him once again as she stood in the cafe, awkwardly waiting for her food to be prepared. The guy came back with a to-go box in hand, flashing her a smile as he handed it to her.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm the chef by the way‚Äù, in a sultry tone.

I felt guilty sharing it with strangers and not the person I trust the most, so I sat her down and explained it all to her, and of course she wasn‚Äôt happy about it. I expected that and I encouraged her to share any feelings she had about other people but she insisted it was exclusive to me cause ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a disgusting pig.‚Äù Well, I was at least happy that I was honest with her. She was noticeably distant for a day, but she came to my apartment the next night. My roommate was out doing some club shit, we don‚Äôt really communicate a lot. So I answered the door and immediately notice that she was acting randy as hell. Ah ha, I am a booty call now. So I figured fuck it I‚Äôd fuck her then we‚Äôd talk about what I told her a couple days prior. We were deep into foreplay when there was a knock on my door. Damn, I thought, I was finna bust a nut and my roommate came back earlier than usual. Well, I was wrong, it was one of my girlfriend‚Äôs friends. One that I mentioned fantasizing about the most. Hmmmmm, I thought, hmmmm did my girlfriend invite her friend over so I have to embarrassingly tell her that I wanted to give her the ol American sausage? Again, my thought was wrong. My girlfriend came to the door and greeted her friend, then whispered in my ear ‚ÄúI brought you a present.‚Äù Decent half chub became a thing of the past. I was full Dwayne ‚ÄúThe Rock‚Äù Johnson at that point. I‚Äôll spare you most of the details but there is one thing that became very apparent that night. I couldn‚Äôt finish with her friend, I felt like I was going to bust a whole mayonnaise jar worth of nut for a solid 20 minutes but I couldn‚Äôt finish. I couldn‚Äôt until my gf decided to finish me off with a nice bj and man that was the best orgasm I ever had. 
After all was said and done, my gf explained to me that she is bi nut never thought to mention it to me because she was afraid I would just ask for a threesome. She said that she felt upset intitiallt when I talked to her, however the more and more she thought about me putting my dick in her friends, the hotter that idea became in her mind. And I told her that I realized that she is the only woman who will ever satisfy me, so we decided that it is one for her to bring girls over as long as we share them.

Careful long rant

I went through something similar but I met him through a dating app...

Now I havent completely come to grips with this situation myself but when I started using these apps it was in hopes of finding someone who I might be able to trust and start learning new things. My friend met her now boyfriend of a year because of tinder and idk it gave me hope.

I knew I was ready to have sex and didnt necessarily need someone I loved but I wanted someone I would trust and this was not the case.

I had been on these dates before and choose bumble this time bc not everyone is looking for a hook up and one night at like midnight my naive ass thought this guy legit wanted food and just to chill for a minute but it wasnt until we parked and he told me to take off my clothes I knew what was happening.

I thought before we might makeout at most and I definitely did not want it to go that far with this guy. I kept trying to push it off but I eventually gave in not knowing what to do.
He did not know I was a virgin and I never told him no but I did not enjoy it and I wish I had said no. 

I learned some things and grew from the experience I hope but I still struggle occasionally trying to find myself again. 

Anyways I blocked him after 2 weeks and am now moving on to the point Ive forgotten his name. ",,tinder,,Sun,6.0,3.0,11.903999999999998,35.64799999999998,21.69599999999999,0.077,0.764,0.159,0.98,21

9799,2019-03-02 23:57:08,"I really hate it when women who have been raped less times than I have tell me I have ""male privilege.""

here's my story. My mother cheated on my father several times. Then one day he decides he doesn't wanna take it anymore. So the day my father decided to confront her about it, she runs to my neighbors house, calls the police and lies to them about how he attacked her. After they release him, she divorces him, takes half of his things that she literally didn't pay a dime for (like she did not work at all the whole time they were married, not a single job or side hustle), and then uses the ""i'm a woman"" card. and so while I'm in her custody, she forces me to go to catholic church where I was molested on sundays, and left me with a babysitter who also loved little boys and raped me every other day for lets say a good 2 months. and after my mom realizes she can't fucking support us on minimum wage, she throws us back to our dad while still collecting child support for the rest of the year we're not being housed by her. and where was my male privilege in all of this? where was my dad's male privilege in all of this? 

and I'm not saying that different treatment doesn't happen. It absolutely does. There are certain things people do to women that's just not fair. And I also understand I'm an anomaly and it is often the case that women are more sexually abused than men. But there are certain things you benefit from that I as a man don't. I wish the court treated both my parents fairly instead of just automatically assuming the mother was the better parent. I wish the man had an equal say in the divorce and I wish he didn't have to give up the things that the woman didn't pay for at all. I wish the fact that she cheated several times factored into who was the more competent parent. 

but why is it not considered insensitive to automatically assume I have it better than you because I have a dick and balls? how many of you can honestly say you have been raped more times than I have whether you're a man or a woman? And furthermore how many of you can say that your rape was a result of a man being mistreated to favor the woman's side in the courtroom? I mean my dad's not a stellar parent but I can promise you I would have never been raped under his custody, but no court was willing to see that, all they were willing to see was the kind, care giving nature of a woman and the rowdy, angry nature of a man (regardless of whether it's true or not that men and women inherently have those properties).

I feel like I'm working 10 or 12 hours a day, and even 5 or 6 on the weekends. My wife has been busy with her job and hasn't really been present at home. I find myself feeling lonely and depressed, much like the students on this page complain about. I guess UCSD does that to you.

Anyways, there is a student in my introductory [REDACTED] class who has been consistently coming to office hours since week 1. He was motivated to learn, but supplementing his interest in the subject was his interest in me. He had sweet, listening eyes. He would really be present with me for the entire quarter. 

About a week ago around the end of office hours, we were the only ones in the classroom. It was a night class so it was getting late, and both of us were tired and hungry. He was still asking questions, so I invited him to go to dinner with me at a restaurant near campus.  He agreed, and we ended up having a really nice time that night. 

I drove him back to the village, and he invited me to his apartment for drinks. He said his roommates had left for the weekend, so we had the place to ourselves. Against my better judgement, I agreed. My wife would probably not mind, I thought. I'm just hanging out with a cool platonic friend from work. 

After some beers, I saw the true intentions that I did not see before. They were always there, deep down. But now they are coming to the surface. Mid-sentence, I stopped talking and looked at him longingly. He looked back at me, and after a brief period of uncertain tension, went in for a kiss. It was the most exciting, passionate, intimate, and satisfying kiss I had in my life. I relaxed a bit, and it started to feel natural. I'm not going to make this post NSFW, but what happened next was a lot of really good sex. I asked him to cum in my ass and call me the ""nutty"" professor hehe.

Going home felt weird. I wanted to stay, but I knew my wife was waiting for me. I showered and cleaned myself up really well, but I felt that she knew. Should I come clean to her? I really think I might be in love with this student too, but I'm worried that he may just be using me for grades.

Senior year of high school she started dating my guy best friend, and of course it got awkward. At first I was pretty like bummed out cause I knew that it‚Äôd changed all of our friendships forever.

And the few times where I needed him there or he‚Äôd asked to hang out I felt as if my girl friend was just secretely starting to hate me. Apparently she does hate me now. She started ignoring me, stopped hitting me up, she doesn‚Äôt look or approach me when we make eye contact in person (walking to class). She goes to UCSD and so does our other girl friend (my roommate), but she only approached her when I‚Äôm not around.  and the times I‚Äôve gone back home on the weekends she decides to visit my roommate. I knew things were getting rocky, which is why I cut off my guy best friend, even after he said that all of our friendships should still be okay. I lost 2 best friends. I‚Äôm sure this is normal but it hurts. I feel like I can‚Äôt talk about it to anyone. I think what hurts me the most is that I‚Äôve gone through hell and back this year. I had two family members pass away in a span of a week, one which I had to keep visiting at the hospital for over a month before her passing, this year has been really tough, and I didn‚Äôt have any of them there for me.

I hate to say it but I feel like I‚Äôm starting to be angry at her for not being there, for cutting me off, I just hate all of this. I think the major thing is that during the time my family member was in the hospital, I had to be going home a lot, and there was times my family couldn‚Äôt pick me up.. and she would drive back home and wouldn‚Äôt even try to ask if I needed a ride. That broke me so many times because I just wanted to be back home with my family. I feel like if she would‚Äôve been a part of my life, so much could‚Äôve gone different, I wouldn‚Äôt be feeling this. But anyways did I do something wrong ?

She just got a boyfriend. Cool huh? Issue is that she never told us. We learned like a month or two after the fact. What? This is kinda important you know... Instead you scare the living crap after us by telling us, ""We need to talk."" God I thought you were dying or in a hospital or got hit my a car, but nope. ""I got a boyfriend.""

Fun fact: I knew the day after they got together because a friend told me she saw her with the guy kissing... Hm...

Now I haven't met him, but I know someone that has. She told me that he's kinda an asshole.  He doesn't really ask permission to do anything, so he gives her hickeys, to the point where she's bleeding from the neck. We approached her cause we saw it, but she doesn't mind!? Bruh, you're bleeding, that ain't fine. Also stop asking us to help cover your blood stains and the red marks up, not my fault you didn't say no to them... And what? You started to get hickeys THE DAY YOU GOT TOGETHER? BOI. TAKE YOUR TIME

This is the problem with her. She's really clueless about love, relationships, etc. I took normal, non-AP, psychology in high school and I think I know more about love than her. They met, got together, started the hickey train, and the PDA in TWO WEEKS. What the fuck? No dates? No ""getting coffee and talking?"" No ""making sure he isn't a murder or a fuckboi?"" What the hell? How do you even know if the two of you are compatible? 

She's also really really submissive. She saids ""no"" but he just does it regardless and she doesn't even flinch. Okay then... What happened to ""no means no?"" What? I don't mind if he grabs you, hugs you, kisses you, cuddles, etc., but not in front of us... Having people see your PDA is awkward, we feel awkward and everyone else feels awkward sitting next to a couple making out... Hell, the professor in comm even commented about it...

I also found out they've been doing ""third base"" stuff. What? She isn't the type of person to do that, and knowing her, she wouldn't of allowed it 6 months ago. As far as I know, she wasn't into that life. What? They're already touching other sexually? I don't even wanna know if they've ""done it"" yet... God that's nasty to even think about.

9624,2019-02-27 00:46:04,"I find it difficult to fit in with people my age. As cliche as this may sound, I personally believe I was born in the wrong era. I was born in Asia and raised almost solely by my grandparents until I was 4, although they continued to look after me until my early teenage years. They're truly wonderful people and I'm proud to say that they (alongside my single mother and my biological uncle who I call my dad) raised me right (as far as I'm concerned) but the downside is that I've absorbed a lot of their mannerisms and viewpoints. While I know which beliefs and points of views to discard as they are wholly inappropriate for today's day and age, enough of their influence on me remain to this day to where I believe I am a middle aged man (at least) in a 19 year old guy's body. Consequently, it's hard for me to make too many friends or find very many romantic interests. In no particular order, here's a list of my characteristics and experiences that lead me to that conclusion (for lack of a better way to introduce this list):

- Throughout middle and high school, I've successfully befriended a number of my teachers and sometimes found their company more enjoyable than that of some of my peers.
- Very down-to-earth 
- Big history and politics nut. Absolutely can't care for and can do without pop culture (at least modern pop culture).
- I generally consider an intellectual, a highbrow person (to a fault)
- Quite behind on the sayings and memes of today. Didn't know what a 'dumpster fire' was (besides a literal fire in a dumpster) until about two months or so ago.
- While I watch people play a variety of video games on YouTube, I am not in any way shape or form a gamer myself.
- I don't have Netflix or Hulu and I genuinely do not recognize them as being legitimate competitors (with regards to their output) to television.
- For me, TV today is crap with too many commercials and too much gratuitous sex and violence. Same goes for movies today. I just find TV 
and movies from yesteryear far better and more entertaining in many ways.
- In regards to TV, I'm a big fan of informative programs (in depth news programs, the news in general, etc. from yesteryear and today) and light entertainment, shit like game shows and comedy programs (panel shows, improv, satire, topical stuff; so shows like Mock the Week from the UK and Whose Line from both the UK and US if you want an idea)
- I generally watch TV shows and movies from at least 30 years ago, if not more.
- I generally don't do animation except for things that make me feel nostalgic (SpongeBob, most of the stuff from early 2010s Nickelodeon and Cartoon Network, The Simpsons, and a few other things). I have never watched anime (nor do I have any desire or interest to) and Disney films are meh to me. I feel like I've outgrown them. 
- I don't care for EDM or rap or most of the rubbish they put on radio nowadays, which puts me at odds with about 95% of this campus and people my age (in my opinion). I'm a big classic rock fan. Love the Beatles (Sgt. Pepper's onwards) although I don't have any other particular bands that I like. I like individual songs more than bands. My music collection is comprised of rock from the '60s to the '90s along with some disco, new wave, instrumental/easy listening, and other things.
- My philosophy when it comes to what I watch and listen to boils down to two main ideas: a) I like what I like and b) I don't care what the hell people listen to/watch these days, if you're really as good as people claim you are, I'll hear about you again in 30 years time and I'll see/watch you then.
- I was taught to respect hierarchy wherever it exists, which makes it hard for me to mix in with the (very active) leadership of the org I'm involved in and get to know them as people. I see them as my superiors rather than as my peers and fellow humans and consequently, I feel that it's improper to pursue anything else but a good working relationship with them. This is in spite of having attended multiple house parties with them where I witnessed them getting absolutely blitzed and consequently got to learn the most incredible and personal things about them.
- My idea of a fun time with friends is around a table with drinks and/or good food and just chatting and laughing the night away in solid conversation. No need for loud music or shouting or a darkened room with flashing lights or drunkenness.
- I am not a clubber. Never envision myself going out clubbing at any time ever. Can't stand club music (specifically it's loudness), generally don't like the club scene, or staying out into the wee hours of the morning.
- Tries to finish all my work so I can sleep by midnight or 1 at the latest.
- Still a defender of the notion that chivalry isn't dead, of treating everyone with kindness and respect irrespective of who/what they are in relation to you, of loyalty and commitment to family, friends, romantic partners, etc. 
- Still explicitly asks girls out on a ""date"", still a believer in giving flowers and chocolates just because, still a believer in true love 
- Similarly, I absolutely do not believe in Tinder. Don't have one, don't intend on making one. I'm looking for something real and enduring. I don't have the time or energy for casual flings or one time hookups.
- Similarly, I don't have the time or energy for fake people and fake friends. Consequently, my circle of friends is relatively small.
- I genuinely believe we (our generation) need to physically interact with each other more and learn to love each other more. We need to stop being so shallow. We need to have more genuine human connection
- I've been told by a variety of people in my life that I act more maturely than the average person of my age. I believe that I'm more mature than a lot of people myself. I do not believe I am anywhere near the most mature being ever, but certainly above average. I know it sounds like I'm tooting my own horn, but judging by what others tell me and from what I believe, I think it's true.
- I have very little patience for immaturity and childish behavior. I'm allergic to bullshit and stupidity (despite possessing the capability to be stupid myself sometimes)
- I look and sound older than I actually am. 

And I think that's about it. 

Essentially, the tl;dr version of all of this is that I have antiquated and unconventional tastes in just about everything when compared to the average 19 year old college kid and it's hard for me to fit in with many people my age. 

I know the list kinda makes me sound like an conceited arrogant bastard, but I swear to you I'm not. I'm not trying to toot my own horn nor am I complaining exactly, I just felt the need to unload, and you know, this has been rather therapeutic to me, it's taken a load off my chest. Feel free to leave your thoughts (or not). If you made it this far (through the whole list), congratulations, you've reached the end. Give yourself a choccy.

Being essentially erased from her life just by a click of a button on a screen. She was my longest and happiest relationship and we had to part ways while we still had feelings for one another. Our entire relationship was long distance and that coupled with me studying abroad for 1/2 a year led to us to come to the decision that maybe it's best, and more logical that we part ways. The part that hurt the most was the part where I had to hug her goodbye as I whispered to her, ""Thank you for the past year and 8 months"". *Kissed one last time* and she then got out of my car and walked back to her home. By far the hardest break up I've ever had to experience. Sometimes I'd like to think that is the reason why I'm not afraid to shoot my shot for anyone I'm interested in now, because nothing will hurt me as bad as that.

So I was wondering if anyone could tell me why people react this way to my choices? I never judge others for drinking, and I am happy that they have found a way to have fun/ relax that suits them. Do others interpret my choices not to partake as judgement for their choices? Is there any way I can avoid this?

I don‚Äôt spontaneously cry or anything like that, but I‚Äôm very prone to making myself feel emotionally hurt. For the regretful things, it‚Äôs always something minor, like how I may come off a little bit savage or self-deprecate myself when joking around with friends. I try to make myself as amicable as possible, and sometimes it worked, but more often than not I end up hating myself for it in the future.

Like, how one of my friends didn‚Äôt do too well on a midterm and I made a rude comment about it. I‚Äôm sure he didn‚Äôt hear it or he probably forgot it ever happened, but I still remember the moment very clearly and I continue to hate myself for it. I may seem emotionally weak or something, but I guess that‚Äôs the price I paid to be so sensitive to everyone‚Äôs feelings and words.

I made the mistake of hurting (and losing) past friends by making certain comments, even if they were never meant to hurt.

I just want to tell you that you were wrong for over generalizing the space and clumping everyone into a single category. Just like many other orgs, KP has its owns pros and cons and to single out KP was just plain wrong. KP definitely provides a community for Fil-Ams and many felt/feels supported by this org and KP has retained them throughout undergrad. However, I will not deny that toxicity within the board space and the community do exists. You were right about instances when problems do not get solved because some people simply do not like to tackle the problem and likes to beat around the bush causing the problem to escalate and worsen. There are instances when it can be clique-y as well. As someone who's been in the space, I admit that there were times when I felt both supported AND unsupported. KP has its problems internally and that's the truth. I personally think that one of the biggest issues is that members of KP tend to deny this fact and do not want to tackle this issue and have a conversation on how we can make the space better. While I agree with those who commented on the original post defending KP, I think it's also important that we also recognize our own faults and work towards making the space better.

Am I going to look like I have some funny straws coming out of me?

But most importantly, I am thinking about them because I found out I can pair them with my android device and I would love to have some stable wireless buds on me. 

I would trust apple airpods to not break on my through normal usage and other general apple products because they maintain their value overtime. That being said, I got the new ipad pro so I could do schoolwork on the go and maintain that tablet style (I also got the keyboard and pencil). I would use my computer but it‚Äôs a little clunky and has way too many processes going on at the same time (and it‚Äôs not SSD, so the fan can be a little loud and embarrassing for me). So I have this tablet because it‚Äôs something that really won‚Äôt slow down on me for a very long time, even with a bunch of processes going on. I won‚Äôt be using much space on this since it is just schoolwork and I suppose games (I currently don‚Äôt have any on here), but I don‚Äôt expect storage usage to go up a lot, nor do I expect to run out. Anyway, I needed consistent fast process to do school stuff so I got it.

So yeah, I think airpods would benefit me for both my devices, but I would like some more opinions. Also, I heard apple would be releasing second gen airpods, and idk if I should wait an undetermined amount of time (end of 2019) or get them now and hope I can trade them in for a cheaper airpods 2 cost? Is that something I can do?

My plan is to get them from the bookstore and I was hoping I can trade them in whenever airpods 2 comes out?

(BTW, sorry if this post is a bit long)

I am interested in this lady who is a member of an org that I am also a part of. She is a very beautiful soul (and a very beautiful person in general); strong but emotionally sensitive with a zeal for life, an intellectual with similar interests to my own, and so very passionate about the org and the people in it. We don't know each other very well or are very close since she spent fall quarter away from UCSD and I've only known her since the start of this quarter (also, I'm relatively new to the org, having joined earlier this school year). 

Anyways, there are a couple issues. First, I seem to forget how to work my vocal cords to produce intelligible English whenever I approach her.  I get so nervous around her that I absolutely lose my train of thought and my ability to make conversation (something I'm generally good at). This has never happened to me before in the past (at least with my recent interests). Second, it's difficult for me to be able to engage her anyway, since she's always flanked by her friends/org-mates before, during, and after these meetings (although we are connected on social media). Third, for reasons that are unclear to me, I don't get along very well with one of her really close friends and I'm afraid that this may lead to future complications. Fourth, she holds a leading position in the org, which may or may not cause problems if I go for it. And fifth, we don't have any classes together, so we only see each other at org meetings a couple times a week for a couple hours each time (with most of that time being dedicated to club-related activities).  

To complicate matters further, I'm planning to leave the org soon to pursue other endeavors. In fact, if I had alternative means to reach out and connect with her, I probably would've already left. She's a year older than I am and graduating at the end of this school year and I feel like if I don't shoot my shot soon, I never will be able to shoot. My goose will be cooked and ready for serving, essentially.

It's because you may have the delusion that there is still a chance despite whatever you might be telling yourself.

You have to accept that it's over and mourn over the loss. Rip the band-aid off. Remove all traces of her from your life: Facebook, Snapchat, other social media, personal pictures, texts, block her calls/texts. Then the mourning (healing) can begin. Once it's over, you'll be happy and move on.

Be honest to yourself: do you think she's longed for you at all in these last 5 years? You're wasting all this time and energy on just this one chick, that you totally could've just met someone else and have been happy instead.

I've been in your shoes, though I was only hung up on the girl for the 3 years we knew each other. I made a move about 1 year into the friendship but it blew up in my face. I held out for the remaining 2, hoping that somehow i would get her to be my gf.

The relationship evolved into an unhealthy one (a little toxic even) and the only thing that ended up happening is that I was used, and not in a sexy way either, but in a more like doing-her-homework-being-a-complete-doormat way. 

Towards the end I tried being just a friend, but realized I was trying to fool myself into believing I could be friends with someone I still had deep feelings for. I was miserable because I knew I could never be more than just a friend, that she was better off without me, etc. etc. (sound familiar?)

I ended up just focusing on my studies instead, forgetting everything about dating and the bullshit that comes with it, graduating, getting a good job, and enjoying the shit out of life. Cutting her out of my life hurt like hell, because I was really in love with her... 

it was the best thing I could've done for myself.

The most important lesson to be learned is not to put every crush on a fucking pedestal. They are a crush, they were never anything to you beyond just a crush. You liking them intensely is not going to make them like you back. Learn how to be shot down like a champ, and move on.

And there have been confessions by girls lately that they feel there is something wrong with them because they don't get catcalled/feel like they don't get enough male attention...look, I understand. If men find you attractive, they treat you like a fucktoy/make creepy advances, and if they don't find you attractive, they treat you like trash/actively disrespect you, if you're not ""fuckable"" to them, clearly you don't deserve basic human decency.

(But seriously being catcalled isn't fun either, but men definitely treat women they want to fuck better than ones they deem ""ugly"")

There really is no winning as a woman.

Can men just treat us like human beings instead of fucking ""mystical mysteries"" or disrespecting us? I know it's apparently news, but you can treat even those you don't want to fuck with decency.

She especially wanted to meet me, an had suggested seeing a show. So I bought tickets and we did. Admittedly, I was a little late, but I apologized profusely and she seemed cool with it. That was my only real fuck up. Anyway, due to the nature of the music (Indie rock), it went on until late and was fairly loud the whole time-we're weren't able to talk much. Then, I weirdly ended up seeing a couple friends from my HS (I'm from SD so it occasionally happens) so I talked with them for a hot couple minutes. After the show, I suggested getting some drinks or food...and she said she was tired. I kinda knew at that point, but she then flip-flopped and agreed to go to this small restaurant open late. So she then ends up standing me up there and lies saying that she was certain it was closed. As I'm there with a table. I apologize again for this apparently horrible date and ask if we could go on a better ""talking"" date to get to know each other. She refuses (I'll give her that she was polite about it) citing that I'm ""too extroverted and sociable"" for her.

As you have probably guessed, I am quite prone/sensitive to yeast infections and I have successfuly kept them at bay, which makes my life much better, and I know others probably struggle with it too (or the opposite issue, BV).

Firstly, if you do have penetrative sex, for the sake of your yeasty friends not overpopulating your cupcake, lube up! A LOT. There cannot be too much lube! Also try not to have penetrative sex too frequently (but if you do, lube the heck up!)

Next, you know how a lot of us with boobies will take off our bra first thing we come home? I started doing that with my undies as well! (And I sleep with no undies now as well too) Invest in lots of long skirts/dresses so you can let your hoo-ha breathe, even when you're out and about! 
(With the exception of when/if you menstruate unless you use tampons/cups then yay! You can let your flippy lips out all month long!)

Personally I don't have much of a sweet tooth, but if you do, try to limit it or supplement with plain yogurt (yes, plain plain, none of that sweet yogurt). It's healthy and helps cultivate some healthy bacteria pals for your yeasties. You can also take probiotic pills but I think just eating better is a healthier option.

These simple things have kept the bakery at bay (especially the not wearing undies as much as possible). I hope this is helpful to someone who is looking to improve their coochie's health! This stuff happens and shouldn't be embarassing to talk about. ‚ù§

*tl;dr/incel content about romantic fantasy to an animated character*

This subject matter seems to be a bit meme-me but I will explained why it's not in the later part of the confession ( and why would I spend so much time writing a whole analytical confession and not submit it in turnitin) . I need to get this thought out of my mind or else it will fester in a weird, anti-social, incel obsession....

So I just watched Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse and I thought, as a self-proclaimed film buff, it is one of the best animated movie I have ever watched. I thought the movie does an excellent job in recreating NYC scenery, and each character was so well made, both in terms of animation and character development. So much well made that it mades me fall in love with Spider Gwen (Ghost Spider).  No, this is not the character fandom love that I am referring to. I mean a somewhat sexual but to a greater extent platonic love like with a real-life human. After I watched the movie I have this childish desire to make mine own particle accelerator like one in the movie and travel in Gwen's universe so I could be with Gwen and makes her mine. No, I don't want to date real life cosplay doppelg√§nger of Spider Gwen. I want to be physically live in the animated Earth-65 universe with animated Spider Gwen. Ironically, I am realistic and pragmatic human being in the real world who never have such weird fantasy in any aspects in my life.  Plus, I never like hentai because of its sickened view of love, i.e love without reciprocation, consent, responsibility and effort. I have been having this fantasy since after the day I watched the movie and felt terrible for having it. I felt futile since my love for Gwen is as real as it gets for a fictional animated characters that made with deterministic human personalities (i.e personalities that in fact are not the consequence of free will but are determined by the producers and the voice actor) and physical look right in the sweet spot of uncanny valley. In other words, it is absurd to have a human love with an inhuman character just because it has seemingly perfect set of human qualities . Even if I even disregard this philosophical-emotional hybrid dilemma, my frustration still stems from the fact it is physically impossible to send at my consciousness into a digital world that would be the animated universe.   If you are a bit of a film buff yourself, my predicaments are similar with the plot of the movie Her but only thing that is different is these feelings are real. For now, I have been blocking any thoughts about Spiderman in general so that I can get rid of this fantasy and hope that by writing this eccentric piece of confession it will help speed up the process because I don't want to be the same person that I disdained to be.

I feel stuck because, yeah, I could get a PhD. I love my subject and am really passionate about it, but I feel like my mental health couldn't handle it and it's not 100% necessary for my goals. I want to teach at a community college and that'd be great. People think I'm aiming too low and it makes me doubt myself and I just end up feeling like a failure who should do nothing instead.

8545,2019-01-05 18:22:41,"I've never been in a relationship before. The last time I almost did was during my first year of college.Being my first year, I was trying to go out, visit the beach and meet people, but more than anything I wanted to build friendships. One evening I found myself visiting one of the dining halls a little before closing. After picking up my food I contemplated going back to my building and just eating my dinner in my room at my desk. I probably wasn't thinking of it like this at the time, but I wasn't giving myself an opportunity to meet anyone if I continued to do that.

So I wandered the dining hall, just a bit. Looking for a familiar face (if there was any).  I did my best to not look lost or like I was trying to not be alone. I was pretty sure there wasn't anyone around, and just as I was about to leave the dining hall, I saw him. He was eating alone, no distractions in front of him. No phone, no headphones. I knew I'd seen him around before, probably in one of my classes or my building. So I walked over and greeted him, we introduced each other and I asked if I could join him for dinner. He accepted. 

We ended up talking a lot that evening, the dining hall had been cleaned and prepped for the next day by the time we were asked to leave. As we were leaving the dining hall I remember not wanting our conversation to end. We spent more time together that night, talking about I don't remember what. A little bit of everything I suppose.

We ended up making plans to go on runs together, grab lunch and dinner together. He even introduced me to some of his favorite shows. I didn't particularly enjoy them for the most part, but spending time with him was fun.
We'd go on runs together, visit museums, go to the beach, do homework in the common rooms. If we weren't in class we were hanging out.

I remember one night when most of his suite-mates were gone, either a holiday weekend or some break like that, we were watching a movie in his room. We were lying on his bed and at some point we just started pushing against each other playfully. This playfulness escalated to the point where I had him pinned underneath me. I never wrestled and I don't normally behave like this.

I lowered my waist to meet his, and as soon as I made contact I put a little more of my weight on him. It didn't take long for us to start rubbing against each other. It was a physical sensation I had not previously experienced.

He was my first lover, my first kiss, my first sleeping with someone. I remember making my way to and from his room those few days in my pj's carrying my pillow and bringing snacks so we could cuddle, ""play"", and watch tv together.

If this was all so great, what are you confessing?

As great as it all was, I wasn't ready for a relationship, heck I'm not even sure if I know what dating means anymore and if I'll ever get around to dating.

I wasn't relationship ready in general. I had no sense of independence and having just started school I was afraid it was too early to start getting into anything like that. 

But more than anything else, I didn't know how to be with someone of the same gender. As much fun as I had, and yes I liked him, there was too much for me to figure out. I never questioned or really thought about my sexual orientation. I didn't grow up particularly religious either. For not having any strong convictions for or against such relationships I was very hesitant to go any further. I never got around to seeing or experimenting with anyone before college.

It's been a few years since then. I distanced myself from him because I didn't want to be thought of anything that I maybe wasn't (if that makes sense?). 

As with some things, hindsight offers me the opportunity to look back and realize that I missed an opportunity to try something new and with someone that was genuinely interested in seeing me grow and grow with me ;)

Having shared all this, I just want to remind myself, and anyone having read this far, that second chances don't come often, and sometimes we fail to recognize opportunities for growth and self-discovery the first time around.

I am a lurker in the bio group chat, and the way that most of the people bullied, or talked to, one of the members really made me sick to my stomach. So apparently this one member was always made fun of and trolled because she said that she just wanted to transfer out of UCSD to UCLA, and she was made fun of for wanting to take premed courses over the summer to get ahead and needing tutor help for a ""easy"" class such as Chem 6A. 
At first, it was just simply trolling her in the group chat by giving random answers to her questions, but then it got to a point where she was outright being bullied and insulted by everyone.
 It is genuinely not right to do this, and I was so extremely shocked to see this happen at such a uni such as UCSD. So what that someone wants to transfer out of UCSD to UCLA? so what if she feels that she needs a tutor for a ""easy"" class such as Chem 6A? 
None of you guys have the right to make fun of someone and bully them for that. Maybe it is parental pressure, maybe she was brought up with those values, who knows? And why should she be made fun of for wanting a tutor for chem 6A? It was right of her to try to seek out help if she feels that she is struggling, because some people really do need that extra help and push at the beginning. This is especially after months of celebrities committing suicide such as Kate Spade and Anthony Bourdain in the news, and the general consensus that self-esteem and mental wellness is a big issue in our generation, so as aspiring physicians (most of you) I hope you all would take that into account. If she wants to spend the extra money on private tutoring or whatever, so be it, stop saying thats bougie or that you dont have the ""resources"" because you are out-of-state or that your broke while going on a boba run every single day and eating out every other meal.

Maybe it's just my own understanding of sex being quite different from most others (I think of it as a way of having fun and it's a separate thing from romantic attraction).

There are times when I think he might like me back with some of the things he does and says but then I also think about our age gap as he is about 4 years older than me. He is a 3rd year and I am a 1st year. I want to tell him just so I know if he likes me back or not but I am worried that if I do it'll ruin our friendship and make things really awkward in the future. We hang out at least a few times a week and are both very active in the organization. Any advice? ,,,,Mon,4.0,4.0,13.875,14.800000000000008,18.83300000000001,0.055,0.806,0.139,0.8616,13
8327,2018-12-23 22:57:39,"Tldr; my boyfriend and I have different religious beliefs, send help. Muslim advice needed for confused outsider .-.


The other day, my boyfriend and I were talking about bringing our relationship out to the public, which is something he‚Äôd be terrified to do because he is Muslim. I was born into a catholic family, practiced christianity for a bit, and am not ashamed to admit that right now I‚Äôm confused and still wondering what religion I believe in the most.  For a bit of context (and I don‚Äôt pretend to know everything about this which is why I‚Äôm seeking advice) the ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù (?) way to find your wife would be for your family to set you up with someone under the same religion, you court them, and then you marry. No room for ‚Äòdating‚Äô an outsider like me. (With the exception of MAYBE if I was very Christian? People of scripture? Apparently there are exceptions type of thing, someone please clarify) Well see WHOOPS, we fell in love. WHOOPS. 

Well now when we for real get deep and talk about us in the context of religion, etc, he says he is torn between two ideas. 1) Knowing that this feels right and that in the end, whether it be marriage or whatever it may be, that it will turn out ok. Things would work out, maybe I‚Äôd even become muslim, or not, (because right now I really don‚Äôt know what I am) but that in the afterlife there wouldn‚Äôt be punishment for loving someone like this. OR 2) This ‚Äúfeels right‚Äù because it‚Äôs a distraction from Shaytan, or in other words Satan, who is making him feel as though something this wrong can actually be okay. And it‚Äôs something he‚Äôs supposed to recognize as a trick or deception? 

I‚Äôm understanding, but it honestly hurts to be in love with someone who for a lack of a better word, is so unsure. I told him that if I went to confession, I don‚Äôt think a pastor would tell me I‚Äôm wrong for being in love with him. Or that I should break it off. And I asked if there was anyone that he could talk to ‚Ä¶ And he said that he knows they would tell him that it‚Äôs improper and to break it off and that he knows that, just doesn‚Äôt want to hear it. I get so hurt thinking someone could believe in something that could teach that love like this is so wrong‚Ä¶ but then again to him, Allah is a metaphysical thing that is above everything we know and feel and so it makes sense that his message is universal and above what we may be feeling. 

This rarely gets in the way, we don‚Äôt fight, we even talk about religion occasionally, and it‚Äôs never a negative experience. It‚Äôs just the residual feeling of sadness I get thinking he‚Äôs scared of this. 

I guess my question is more for the Muslim community. Give me perspective. Give me advice. Am I supposed to want to push him away for his own beliefs? Or what am I supposed to think. Have you as a Muslim ever accidentally fallen in love with someone outside of the Islamic belief system? What is he or I supposed to do according to your beliefs? And Christians, what about you? 


To anyone who may think: ‚ÄúIf he loves you, he‚Äôd change,‚Äù no. Please don‚Äôt even comment. I‚Äôve come to learn and respect his ideas wholeheartedly. Love or any human feeling does not trump the word of Allah to my man and though it‚Äôs not something I fully understand, I stand by him and support his decision to believe that.

8325,2018-12-23 19:43:19,"I spent a significant amount of my parent's money applying to transfer to the University of Oxford from UCSD, and a shit ton of energy, effort, and motivation writing my personal statement, asking for a reference letter, gathering example essays I've written, and studying for the admissions test. 
I was eventually shortlisted and flew over to the University of Oxford at short notice in December for a week for admissions interviews. I had a fairly splendid time there, but I honestly do not know how I did: I met some awesome people there, got free room and board, and was able to eat for free for a week in THE Harry Potter dining hall and at the staircase and took some bomb ass photos as well. I really enjoyed my time there, getting to sleep in a 500 year old dorm just above a world famous picture gallery right next to one of the oldest cathedrals in the world. 
My point is, I am so nervous, so anxious, so hellbent on the admissions decision that would come out on the night of January 8th, 2019. I know that I should not be defined by a college decision, but whether or not I get accepted will obviously change so many things for me and my family.
If I am not accepted, I will take it as having had a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to experience Oxford, both as a vacation and as an educational experience.
However, if I am accepted, I will have the option to withdraw from UCSD immediately and spend time saving up money until the next academic school year. I will be classmates with extremely intellectually stimulating classmates, and even some whom are members of British aristocracy. (during my short time there I have already met someone whose dad was one of the most famous comedians and writers of the 20th century). If I do get in, I feel like my parents work will all have paid off since they have invested over $1500 dollars into this application process, mainly the transportation. 
Since I was invited for an interview (not everyone is), I feel so close yet so far from making it, and I am trying my best to take my mind off of it during winter break and trying to enjoy the holidays, but it is really difficult :(
None of my friends know that I applied btw because I honestly can't deal with the blow of being rejected and people asking me about the results :'(

Two days ago, I asked OP for another chance - I told her I made a mistake and I want to do right by her, by me and by us. She (after a lot of pleading) finally agreed to give me one last shot and this post today is meant to be something to help me clear my conscience before a new beginning, as well as my plea to all other people in a relationship to not make the same mistakes I did.  Ever since that night that I first saw you in class, my life hasn‚Äôt been the same my love. I enjoyed our journey as much as you did. But I also know it hasn‚Äôt been easy for you. You told people the smiles and rainbows of us. It‚Äôs only fitting I bear the blame for our darkest moments before I can proceed on a fresh start with you.

I remember looking at u for the first time in our class of 24 people and just thinking to myself, those are the prettiest eyes and smile I have ever seen. I remember you in your olive jeans and denim jacket and being mesmerized with you from that first class. I remember coming over to your place to do homework and asking you out that same night. I told you that I didnt wanna be without you one moment because I didnt want to risk loosing you to some other guy who may ask you out. That was the beginning of our adventure which you proceeded to tell people about in 7447. Thank you baby for saving me the effort of typing so much out. My confession is going to be relatively shorter.

I have hurt you a lot. I know. This isn‚Äôt the first time I‚Äôve screwed up - I know. Over the course of one year, I have been battling a lot with my own paranoia and what it means to live life and I have projected that onto our relationship many times causing you so much pain. My insecurities about us, about myself, would take many forms - sometimes I would think dedicating time to you would snatch away from my classes and perhaps I should end it so I could focus on myself more. Sometimes I would think - I‚Äôll eventually go off to grad school and we‚Äôre statistically going to break up then; maybe I should save us the heartbreak and just end this now. I kissed another girl when in a wrong frame of mind. And this last time - I convinced myself that no matter how good our story is there are just parts of us that are incompatible. 

I believe that a lot of other people out there face such decisions as I well. They can‚Äôt decide whether the choices they make are right or wrong and are often just befuddled by my relationship. Baby I‚Äôve never been under so much distress under any of my relationships and I honestly feel that my paranoia comes from the fact that your really the first girlfriend whose stood out to me as someone I may wanna spend my life with. As a result, my brain tries to find all the reasons to not let go and surrender myself to you. I keep coming up with excuses and reasons why we shouldn‚Äôt be together (as listed in the past paragraph), when the only real think I had to consider was whether I wanted to be with u and whether or not you made me happy. I tried to find the 100s of reasons why we can‚Äôt work when all I needed to look for was the one reason we can. And that reason is simple - you send butterflies through my stomach everytime you throw me a sincere smile, or sashy with attitude, or even when ur just lying on my chest at 7am before we start the day and go to our classes.

Baby this relationship has caused us both to go through tough times and I‚Äôm blessed that I got to go through these things with someone as strong as you. You‚Äôve helped me through one of the most uncertain periods of my life. I‚Äôm not gonna lie - I dont deserve you baby - I really don‚Äôt. You were there for me high and low and now I want the chance to be there for you as well. You‚Äôve helped me when I wasn‚Äôt sure of what it even meant to love. You were with me when I kissed someone else when half drunk - sure u were as angry as hulk and ik the incident hurt u way more than you let on in front of me - but I‚Äôm fortunate that you didn‚Äôt leave me in that treacherous time.

A lot of this is really personal to me and the only reason I‚Äôm posting it on a page like this is because I want to encourage people to learn from the mistakes I‚Äôve made and from the things my baby did right. Through this past year I‚Äôve learned that to be in love with someone is more than the moments you share with them, the songs you both jam to, the hours you spend studying before a final, the crazy adventures you take with one another. To love someone is to believe in someone else. To love is to forgive and persevere. I‚Äôm not saying that everyone should be forgiven for whatever wrong doings they do in a relationship. But I am saying that it‚Äôs unfair to keep posing hypothetical questions about why things will fail, instead of posing the hypothetical question what if things work. I made that mistake and my girlfriend was strong enough to stick by me through each high and low - and for that I am grateful. I wish I could be more like you baby. 

Try to trust people with your heart. 

P.S. my love if you read this, you recently asked me why you should give me another chance. And baby, all I have to say is that I want another chance to do right by you.

Here's what I have to say to both parties:
To those who find it necessary to critque others bodies: what benefit do you gain from saying so? First of all, you're wrong to say that nobody likes fat girls since there definitely are people who do. You may be correct in saying that a majority of guys don't like fat girls but really is this the way youre going to go about it?

To my keyboard warriors and others who feel affected: They're not completely wrong. I know it sucks to hear it, and it might come off shitty, but people do have physical preferences, and for a majority of guys being bigger is not a plus. Granted, its not the only thing that matters, but it is very hard to want a relationship with someoen you have no physical desire for. The reason I feel the need to say this is not to make people feel bad, but to not allow them to have false notions of themselves. Nobody deserves to ask ""why don't people like me"" and not be able to get an answer. Some people truly don't care about how others perceive them, and to them thats actually amazing! But to those that do, well now you have it.

I'm not trying to shame anyone or whatever, but I feel like people need to know the truth and stop being fake. ",,rant,,Fri,10.0,17.0,43.0,44.548000000000044,34.915999999999954,0.131,0.706,0.164,0.8801,16

Thanks for giving your story and opinion about the topic. Im sorry that t happened to you, but im glad in the end you could find a compromise with it. For me, especially being in college and around people who drink pretty regularly the not letting my father dictate my actions on drinking has come up pretty often in my head. It's honestly a constant struggle because I go back and forth about the situation pretty frequently. I don't want him to control my actions on the matter because if he wasn't the way he was then I probably would drink just like any other college student. But I can't help but feel like a hypocrite. I grew up hating what he was and that alcohol was the thing that made him that way. That's properly the main reason why I don't want to drink (but also I just dont like the weird looks that people give me because I choose not to. Like let me live my life lol).

I feel like the people who are supposed to be my closest friends don‚Äôt even care about me. I‚Äôm never invited to anything they do and it hurts to feel like I wasn‚Äôt even considered as someone who could potentially be included in their plans. They never even ask what I‚Äôm doing or if I have any plans before I just see them all hanging out without me and I can‚Äôt help but be sad about it, and feel left out. 

People always joke around and say that I know everyone or I‚Äôm friends with everyone but it‚Äôs upsetting to feel like I have a lot of people who are friends on the surface but no one who is particularly close. All the people that I consider my closest friends have their own friends that they would consider their closest, and I‚Äôm sad that I don‚Äôt have with anyone the kind of friendship where we‚Äôre mutually best friends. 

I just want to stop being excluded all the time and feel like I belong somewhere. I honestly wish I went to school with my best friends in high school, because I feel like I haven‚Äôt been able to find friends like that here.

Second of all, that is what pairing is like. A process. Not a system. The board that does the pairings tirelessly work to do them in the best interest of the kuyas ates and adings. People probably like you that only write one worded answers make the whole process a lot more difficult. How are they supposed to know how to pair you if all you write is that you are afraid of spiders or some shit. Open up for fucks sake, talking about your vulnerabilities isn't taboo.  Do you even know WHICH board does pairing? Are you aware of what is actually going on behind the scenes or is your petty attitude slipping out of your ass and on to facebook.

But I chose not to tell her my feelings because I knew I would not be ready for a relationship with everything coming at me at once. I told myself she was just a creation of my imagination; a facade that I created. I mean I really didn‚Äôt know her that well right? And she probably didn‚Äôt feel the same way anyway. And how would family and friends feel about this?  I had too many excuses that justified that she would be better off without me. And I still live in denial to this day.

Yet as the years pass by, she has become more distant from me. She‚Äôs now staff in a club that I‚Äôm not comfortable in which just makes her seem much farther away. We no longer seem to share anything in common anymore. I no longer have feelings for her but I live in pain knowing I let her go. 

I‚Äôm sorry Jade Tran. On the sidelines, I‚Äôve watched you grow so much as a person. You are someone that sees the world in the future. Don‚Äôt dwell on the past because of this confession. Don‚Äôt try to find out who I am. Chances are, you know who I am already. But if anything, I was the one that made the mistake of falling for you during my emotional roller coaster. And I‚Äôm certain that if we were to have been together, I would still be a hinderance to your growth which is something I don‚Äôt want to happen.

Someday, maybe our paths will cross again. But I‚Äôm still riding out this wild emotional roller coaster of mine. But maybe when I‚Äôm ready, I‚Äôll contact you.  Maybe ask to meet up again and catch up to just hang out. to see how times have been to you, to see how you feel, and maybe even if you have a boyfriend and if he‚Äôs treating you well. 

Until then, I hope that your friends, your club, your family, and other loved ones treat you well and that they act as the fertilizer for your success.

I met this person at a party (we're both guys) and I did the usual small talk to find out his hobbies, interests, and plans in the future, so everything is fine right? It was kind of awkward, and I'd chalk it to myself because breaking ice is something I'd rather avoid but everything was fine. A bit later into the party we'd hang out and talk to other people, and I get this weird vibe from this dude, some sort of social ineptness? Whenever someone else would be talking, he would say something really off-beat or inappropriate to the conversation, for example:

(Random person is A, he's B)
A: So yeah when I was walking down the Promenade with my friends we saw a group of guys speeding down in their lambo-
B: What kind of wheels did they have?
A: Huh?
B: ... well what wheels did the cars have?
A: Uh, I don't remember sorry... Anyway, well they ran three red ligh-
B: How can you remember the car but not even the wheels?
A: I don't understand?

And at this point I kind leave quietly and talk to some other people there, and person A also makes some excuse to leave the conversation. Later on when the host of the party started to announce some sort of ice-breaker game (think like talking to other people across the table from you in the dining area about your favorite etc etc), and this dude finds me again and decides to sit next to me. Well at least since he's beside me I'm not really going to talk to him, right? As it turns out I had to listen to his conversation because the other side of the long table rotates while our side stayed put, and in every conversation he'd make some sort of awkwardly self-deprecating remark and weave in some niche jokes he has and I'd just watch the other person smile awkwardly too. At the end of it he tries approaching me again and this time I stop trying to entertain him and straight up leave to talk to other people. 

Am I an asshole?

 I feel like this dude has aspergers or something and has trouble with communicating with others, but I felt like I was just babysitting someone and being some sort of designated driver for everyone else to not come into a conversation with him. I'd have some nice talks with other people but he'd always try to come into my circle and include a random joke about killing himself (these jokes can be funny at the right times but he wasn't hitting any of those right times) and everything just gets awkward. Like I get it, don't call him out struggling with talking but at the same time who would actually enjoy someone's company when you don't click with them, even less barely manage to tolerate how they talk?

Anyone else think music is too powerful of a medium to be taken lightly? like I think its wrong (to a certain extent) if the only purpose of making music is to make money. And I feel that that's what quite a few popular musical artists have become or always have been from the start. 

i think that the intentions to create music should be purely wanting to make sounds (or lack thereof) that they genuinely find beautiful AND meaningful (i think there needs to be both). Like music made with this intention i think are the best songs of all time regardless of what genre it is. Music is a medium that can (imo better than other mediums such as poems, essays, paintings, etc.) efficiently communicate emotions, arguments, ideas, etc. and this should be taken advantage of to its full capacity. And i dont think some popular artists do this at all, and they simply make music to make money or gain popularity. 

I guess I personally just value genuineness a lot haha and dont respect people's DECISION (only, not the individual themselves) pursue a lot of money and keep it (like if i had a lot of money, I would give it all of it away immediately to those who desperately need it right now rather than investing it and contributing to the economy because i think making sure everyone has adequate living conditions RIGHT NOW is more important than growing our economy and hoping this growth provides better living conditions for the poor.)

7653,2018-12-02 18:20:33,"Response involving @7543 and @7609
Since there‚Äôs been at least two questions regarding it, I wanted to throw my two cents on the whole fat girl issue and then explain. 

First of all, I am a guy who prefers fat girls. Yes we do exist, and we‚Äôre probably not what you think we are.

Off the bat, I need to say that, at least in my case, this preference isn‚Äôt something definite to mean that any girl who is fat is immediately sexy. In my life, I have been attracted to thinner girls as well-it‚Äôs just that I tend to find the softness and curves of a bigger girl sexier. I also need to explain that there is not just one kind of fat girl. For some reason, idiotic people like @7543 will just group anyone with more body fat than average together as just ‚Äúfat people‚Äù. At least for me, a fat admirer (Usually known online as a FA), this is beyond narrow-minded. Women, fat or skinny, come in so many different shapes and sizes and everyone has different preferences for the ideal distribution of (Or lack of) fat is. What I‚Äôm trying to say is that just because people like me say we like fat girls doesn‚Äôt mean than anyone with a big belly (Don‚Äôt call it fupa. It makes you sound even more like an asshole btw), or a phat booty will be attractive to an FA; it can help, but it isn‚Äôt the end all. At least in my case, I personally think that facial features and height are of greater priority when determining how physically attractive a girl is than just how fat they are. However, this isn‚Äôt the case for all those who are prefer fat people which leads me to my next point.

The reason that FAs like myself are so afraid to proverbially, ‚Äúcome out of the closet‚Äù is because of the enormous stigmas around our preference. And this is mostly due in part to the associations that FAs have with fat fetishism. If I would even mention that I liked fat girls to my guy friends, they would immediately not only make fun of me, but think that I was only into really big girls. The stigma is never thought of as that you like thicc girls, or girls with a few extra pounds-you must like morbidly obese girls or girls whose weight is detrimental to their health. Therefore, you are a sicko and gross. In terms of girls, if an FA were to tell them that they thought they were hot or that they liked larger women, they would run-simple as that. That‚Äôs because most big girls know about the small percentage of ‚Äúfeeders‚Äù out there who gain sexual pleasure from their girl grotesquely gaining weight. And I don‚Äôt mean to fetish shame, but most girls should be scared-that‚Äôs crazy unhealthy and wrong. Because of these really strong associations with very, very negative sexual appetites, people who just like fat girls the way they are risk a whole lot when coming out. And when coupled with the whole ‚Äúyou must like all fat people‚Äù stigmatism I talked about earlier, it makes it tough to just come out and tell people ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a guy who like fat girls‚Äù like @7609 requests. Part of me wanted to make this whole soapbox speech public but I knew I couldn‚Äôt. Maybe someday, but not now.

So in the end I want to tell fat girls that there are good guys who will love you and your curves for all eternity. It‚Äôs a rough community I‚Äôm not going to lie-but just know that you can be loved and thought of as beautiful just as anyone else can be : )",,"trigger warning, serious, kinky",,Sun,34.0,37.0,84.42000000000016,127.46999999999987,85.05000000000018,0.06,0.788,0.152,0.9957,18

7587,2018-11-30 18:45:44,"I find societally rejected culture fascinating cause they‚Äôre all so fucking similar. Anyways I have a theory on why people become incels, neckbeards, niceguys, red pill... you get what I mean. 

It starts, of course, at childhood. They all share one similar thing, they don't socialize well. They turn to video game, fantasy, weeb, and/or online culture --anywhere where they can find an escape from reality, establishing one of the foundations of this culture, anonymity. 

When they're in an escape from reality, they don't tend to exercise that much. Playing video games all day or watching anime doesn't exactly get you fit, and hence a majority of them are either overweight or underweight, and they definitely do not have any muscle mass. They are weak, and because of it they strive for something they believe that makes them unique, more purposeful than their peers and counter parts (the jocks/chads) intelligence. Whether they are actually smarter than the average Joe or not doesn't really matter. This is why all or a majority of the people in the societal reject culture have some autistic fascination with intellectual superiority, and once again establishing this foundation of the culture.

This fascination with intellectual superiority comes in several forms. For instance fedoras come from the idealistic renditions of the ""classic men,"" one that culturally superior than the current counter parts. Another is being a jackass religious atheist (i.e. that guy that's like ""OH, YOU ACTUALLY BELIEVE IN JESUS?!??"".)

Most of this stuff usually occurs around or post puberty. With puberty, comes sexualization. This is when their hatred becomes internalized and targeted towards women, since a majority of their interaction with any person in real life in a non professional/family setting is generally targeted towards girls because they are trying to get some action. Of course, most girls are not into them because of several different reasons, and decline. First impressions usually leave a lasting impression. They cope, and this is where some of the culture splits, some thinking that the issue is not with them because it's impossible in their minds (I mean if you're the most intelligent being on this planet, who wouldn't love you). For incels, they think it's because of their physical appearance. For nice guys, they think its because girls like assholes or something similar to that aspect.

Things ended because he thought we were too different of people to continue. I think somewhere deep down in my heart I know it too, I‚Äôm just not 100% convinced. He wanted someone more on his career path, (we‚Äôre both engineers but different kinds) as he felt like that‚Äôs the area to have a connection that matters most to him. To be honest, everything else was fine. We had different views but similar life values, so we taught each other a lot about the world. 

We made a promise the first day we met that where ever this led us, we would try to remain friends, because a connection like this is too big to sacrifice. (As cliche and naive as that sounds.) I still talk to him every few days and we‚Äôre going to a concert to see our favorite artist (of all time, the one we bonded over) together this summer. It‚Äôs just things have changed, and will take some getting used to. It hurts but maybe this is a time to reflect on myself.

I mean I like that kinda food too, but it gets old after going to the same ones every week. And then she always passively makes me feel like shit for craving an ""unhealthy food item"" like pizza. We haven't eaten pizza in 2 months and even then, it was cauliflower-crust! In addition to that bs, she's always at the gym-which is fine as I go there too (Not at the same time usually though due to scheduling) but as you can probably figure out, it's ALL the time now. She'll go multiple times a day sometimes so I barely even get to see her. When I ask if she's trying to avoid being around me or would like to take a break, she claims that she still loves me. And when we're together we do occasionally have good fun (And good sex). But tbh,  I think she's more in love with her bony-ass body since she never seems to walk-the-walk in wanting to spend time with me and especially want to enjoy life with me. It's just such a shame since I love her so much and we have so much history. But whenever I try to ask for a compromise and say she should cool it with the fitness shit, she loses her mind and gets all defensive ending in an argument that I always end up losing. I think I'm done but it's going to be a rough winter for me  : ( ",,,,Wed,17.0,12.0,61.2479999999999,59.15999999999994,80.15600000000015,0.102,0.715,0.183,0.9859,14

Suddenly she was there. The girl you introduced me to in passing, the cute ginger one, smiling, laughing, all done up with you holding her hand with a ring on the left hand. I close the window on my computer but the image is already burned into my mind. You‚Äôre getting married, and it‚Äôs not to me. 

The night we broke up, you cried as you detailed the proposal, a Disneyland parade with lights and fireworks and everything you know I love with all my heart and could never say no to. The date you told me it would happen has long past, but you described it so vividly I remember it as if we actually were engaged at some point. Maybe that‚Äôs why this hurts. 

I know I‚Äôll see the photos. One day I‚Äôll be browsing and see you in a suit, probably the same one you wore to your sister‚Äôs wedding, but it‚Äôll be you at the altar instead. It‚Äôll be her in the white gown walking down the aisle with happy tears and beaming smiles, anticipating a life with you, the one that was promised to me so many years ago. I didn‚Äôt want it then, and I don‚Äôt want it now, but for some reason I still remember what it felt like when you bought me flowers just because. When you drove an hour out of your way to bring me my favorite drink at work, or kidnapped me from class just to drive around dirt roads and blast music when I was sad. I ended it, and I needed to at the time, but now that I‚Äôm a little more grown I recognize that it was those kinds of things that convinced me that you loved me, maybe even a little bit. 

I hope you surprise her at work with a soundtrack of her favorite songs and dozen bouquets of roses.
I hope you have big dreams of travelling to Europe together for the summer and spending a week in Spain just because. 
I hope you took out all your anxieties and insecurities on me so she‚Äôd never have to feel them. 
I hope you don‚Äôt shake her like a doll when you get upset. 
I hope her wrists are free of bruises and scars from you pinning her to a cold concrete floor.
I hope she doesn't spend her afternoons sobbing in your bathroom listening the splintering of wood as you tear down the door.
I hope your hands never touch her throat and leave her crying for air and a sense of sanity. 
I pray you gave me all the high and lows of bliss to bad moments, so she could have only your best self.

There's this cute/nice guy who has expressed that he'd like to pursue a long term relationship with me. We've messed around a few times in the past, but have never properly dated. I'm considering giving it a try, but dating a guy long term would ultimately require me to fully come out to family and friends (would not want to hide the relationship, effectively putting him back in the closet) and I'm not sure I'm ready for that (though I know I need to do it at some point).

Before this guy reached out and laid this on me I had been talking with an equally cute/nice girl, and we've hung out a few times. I'm not entirely sure she's interested, but I feel like something might be there and was considering pursuing a relationship with her.

Clearly I have to choose one or the other. This dude whose definitely interested or this girl who might be.

**disclaimer: sorry for not making this as gender inclusive as i could
and i'm sick of teaching my hook-ups what to do SO:

some sex tips:
FOR PLEASURING A FEMALE-IDENTIFYING PERSON/PERSON WITH A VAGINA/WOMAN:
grab her waist when you're making out with her and fucking her from behind
grab her hair **at the base** but not from the ends of the hair, which hurts in a bad way. you kinda wanna comb through her hair and scrunch it
before eating her out, make out with her a bit, kiss down her body, kissing her neck, boobs (fun!), stomach, inner thigh, teasing her before going down on her
once you're down there, keep your hands moving about! massage her legs, scratch down her back and make her writhe! stick your pointer finger in and make a ""come hither"" motion, not a PUMP IN AND OUT motion (unless she wants that!)
not used that often but pretty nice: play with the kit like you're rolling a dial, i suppose. like that dial on a desktop mouse?? you can use your pointer finger or **your thumb**! it's actually pretty nice!
when fucking her, try growling! it's really hot. it's a deep, gutteral noise. SUPER hot.
ask if she's into spanking! if she is: COOL do u know how nice it is to spank an ass? if not, that's ok~

FOR PLEASURING A MALE-IDENTIFYING PERSON/PERSON WITH A PENIS/MAN:
you can also grab his waist when you're going down on him! putting pressure at the hips increases his sensation.
boys like their hair pulled too! same as above ^
when going down on him, here are some things you can do:
1. suck his balls. just put the entire ball in your mouth and get it all wet. massage the other one.
2. PRESSURE. apply pressure while going up and down the shaft. add extra pressure as you look him in the eyes. 
3. with your tongue, flick the frenulum. its where the head and the shaft meet. super sensitive. flick the head in general. swirl your tongue around the head. give lots of attention to it. edge the fuck out of this boy.
4. just fuckin' commit to deep throating! just put it all in! YOU CAN DO IT. if you gag, even better cuz that'll cause a lot of drool, and isn't drool just the best?
5. while going down, also scratch down his back. he'll writhe. it's fun.

IN GENERAL:
offer to give them a massage~ we're all in pain, and it's sensual ykno
scratches down the back
light kissing, nibbling, and licking on the outer ear lobe (like along the ear.. pls dont lick inside the ear lol)
when making out, throw in a ""bite the lower lip""
BE VOCAL PLEASE
ask if they're into spanking, choking, biting (HARD biting), scratches, etc! if they are, COOLLLLL, you've found a fun sex buddy :D

There are other reasons why, but it's too specific to my situation to confess. We've talked about it and he reassured me that he's not, and knowing how he is he probably isn't. Also, this is stalkery but there's this one girl I noticed he follows that's super pretty and dresses well and seems like she has a really cool personality. My intuition is she was a Tinder match for various reasons. Recently I quickly glanced at his phone as my eyes were wandering, and he was looking through his instagram dms and her icon was there near the middle/top and one of them sent a heart. Ok this is pretty stupid it was a split second and I'm overthinking probably, but is it ok for me to be so anxious about her?

I just want to slap every Republican in the face with this thing called ethics because yeah, if you vote for a racist, you inherently value racial equality less than whatever personal gain you'd get, which means you don't fucking prioritize racial equality and I'd say that's racist. And if you don't want more votes counted in close races, then you're saying that people's votes aren't of equal value and that is undemocratic, might as well be a dictatorship if the government can control when to stop vote tallies for them to be in their favor.
