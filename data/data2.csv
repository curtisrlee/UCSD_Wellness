Not like I'm really shy lol-I just have uncommon interests which makes it hard to connect. I just feel that I don't vibe with anyone and it makes me feel lonely, sad, and hopeless. And when the stars align and I actually find someone, they're either taken, not interested in my gender, or too far away. People keep telling me to try and ""go on more dates"" and that ""you'll find the right person eventually"", but with each year passing, it seems less and less likely.

6029,10/22/2018 22:43:26,"There's this beautiful trans girl from my work that just recently ""came out"". Since she's come out she's become really expressive and open. She has a big personality and is really flirty. Everyone loves her and she has great energy, which is why I'm so conflicted about some of her actions. 
She has a crush on multiple guys at our work. She's very touchy and will straight up touch ass/abs when she hugs the guys she likes. Some of them finally put their foot down and said she makes them uncomfortable with all the touching, and instead of being cool about it she's really rude to them now. 
If the roles were reversed and a girl told a guy to stop touching her and the guy started treating her like shit, we would all say that's fucked up behavior and call it out. But no one says anything. 
She also straight up sexually harasses one guy who's too nice to tell her he's not interested. He hugs her and is friendly because he's a chill, good person but he told me something she said the other day to him and he was definitely bothered by it. She told him ""Just give me one night baby, I'll rock your world"" and later asked him to meet her in the storage room upstairs so she could suck his dick. I repeat, if a guy said these things to a girl, we would all call it sexual harassment, but everyone loves her and just says ""She's silly, it's all fun and games"" when in reality it's fucking creepy and wrong and I'm disturbed witnessing it.

I've had a handful of opportunities to apologize for the wrong I've done. And On several occasions I've been forgiven. Before I hear that from them, I always think that once I hear they're okay, that I can be okay with myself. But it just doesn't work like that. It just makes me feel two things. One, it makes me feel inferior that somebody is just that much more powerful of a human being that they can take what I've done, and just cast it aside and move on with their life. Then two, it makes me contemplate how much better they could have been if I didn't destroy them. And instead of being freed from guilt, I live through it even more knowing they gave me what I didn't deserve. I feel like if they won't hate me for what I've done, I have to hate myself on their behalf and so I do. ",,,

***sorry really long rant but thanks in advance if you read it all***

To those who spew out false, untrue, one-sided and adulterated ""gossip""/information. Why? Do you get a kick out of it or something? Do you feel the need to validate yourself with these uninformed lies in order to contribute to ""tea time""? 

Why do you want to slander someone for something that you probably don't even know the truth and the whole story about? Get your facts right. Ask them directly. And if they don't want to tell you, chances are, it's not even your place to butt in and spread rumors and lies about. And if you heard the truth from them, and still choose to change the story to either dig yourself a deeper hole for your lie, or just because you don't like them: why? Why would you want to create so much hate and drama in the circle, the group, or whatever it is? I don't get it.

Your words hold a lot more power and consequences than you think. You can ruin friendships, bonds, trusts and even lives. One simple lie or misunderstanding can spiderweb into something a lot bigger, but you're so filled with angst/hate and bent on creating drama and tea that you don't even see past it. And if you do see past it and still continue to do so? I'm sorry but you might be a sociopath. 

To those who listen and believe them, whether it be blindly, unintentional or with malicious thoughts: think twice before you accept it at face value. Ask the source directly. Talk to them about it. Get to know the other side before you judge them. You don't get to know someone by just hearing and reading things about them. You talk to them and get to know them yourselves. Who they are to these other people, aren't necessarily who they are to you. 

Lastly, to those who have been wronged by those who just love to jump to conclusions, I'm sorry. It sucks, I know. But you got two options: 1) dgaf and just move on. Be the bigger person. Those who spread these lies and perpetuate them, probably aren't worth your time anyway. Be the best person you can be and those who see you in the light will get their answer. Just be careful. Having everything pent up isn't good for you. 2) Right their wrongs. I know, it's bullshit having to fix something that wasn't even your fault in the first place sucks. But if you want to actively go out there and fix it? More power to you. If you want to get confrontational, go for it. Just know when to cut your losses.

Look, I'm not bringing hate to those who jump to conclusions, because I'm sure we all have done so in the past. I'm just saying, just be careful of what you say. On both ends. People can misconstrue what you say and it could turn into something completely different. 

If you know who I am. Let's talk. I'm not mad or angry. I'm just disappointed and a little sad that you think that way of me. I'm sorry for all of times if I've ever offended you, fucked up or wronged you. It wasn't my intention. I don't want to hate anyone. It takes too much energy for something so unnecessary. I know I'm probably gonna get a lot of hate or spite because of this, but it's just been weighing on me a lot lately.

- M

tldr; be careful of what you say. find the truth directly.",,,

I'm starting to find my friends a bit dumb and I don't know what to do. I love my friends but I'm starting to feel like I can't have a conversation with them because they don't understand (nor care to understand) anything deeper than everyday shallow stuff. They don't know how to plan ahead or take care of themselves, and a lot of them don't study well/have poor grades. It's something that's really shameful to me (that I think this way of them), and I always try to understand them and I've never directly told my friends what I think because they have their own awesome personalities and skills that extend beyond being smart and I don't want to hurt their feelings. But I can't help thinking this way every time something comes up that makes the intelligence gap glaring and I want to change my mindset somehow, or at least understand why I might be feeling this way.

6114,10/24/2018 14:46:01,"Here's a scenario:
You're a dude. You go to a club, you see some hot girl, walk up to her, she flirts with you, you buy her a drink, she disappears.
You gave her attention, you gave her a drink. She took them and left. Does she owe it to you to: keep flirting with you after getting the drink? No. Dance with you? No. Give you her number? No. Go home with you? No. Sleep with you? No.
A similar thing happens with guys who are overly nice to some girl they are attracted to. They keep doing favours for her and whatnot. The girl takes it, and isn't interested in them romantically, so then he asks her out and gets rejected. Again, she doesn't owe him a date or anything.
Eventually, most guys get it. It gets drilled into them. On reddit, on facebook, on snapchat, in the media, in real life, with memes, with jokes, with posts, with subreddits (r/niceguys), with articles. We all know about Nice Guy‚Ñ¢ and most guys get it that you shouldn't expect anything back.
But when it comes to girls, a lot of them don't get it at all. I don't understand why.
A guy was treating you well at first, you sleep with him, and he stops treating you well or disappears or just doesn't do whatever you were expecting. Does he owe it to you to: keep giving you the same attention? No. Sleep with you again? No. Date you? No.
Just like with the other scenarios, whether it's nice to do this or that is debatable and depends. I, personally, draw the line between asshole behaviour or not at explicitly (or implicitly in an obvious way) promising something and not doing it. BUT that is not the point. They still do not owe it to you to reciprocate or continue whatever they did before, just because you offered something. So, either don't offer whatever it is you're offering or learn to live with the consequences. In other words, don't complain about it. It's as annoying as the Nice Guy‚Ñ¢ thing.",,,

My main reason for being an atheist is the amount of needless pain and suffering in the world. It makes absolutely no sense to have an all-powerful, benevolent god watch on and do nothing as there‚Äôs bombs being dropped on middle eastern children, as there‚Äôs kids in the cancer ward not living to see their 8th birthday, as there are kids being raped as we speak.

I‚Äôve been told that God is benevolent and all-powerful, but such a God that watches all of this and does nothing is either Not Benevolent or Not All-powerful. He has the power to end all innocent suffering in the world, and chooses not to. You could ration this out to original sin or what have you, but you try telling the parents that their child deserved to be raped and killed, and God watched as it happened.

A few months back my girlfriend and I went to see Black Panther. I'm a huge Marvel fan so I was really looking forward to this. 
But throughout the movie this obnoxious guy kept yelling dumb shit like ""this guy bout to die!"" and just obnoxious stuff in general. 
It really ruined the experience for a me. But my girlfriend kept fucking laughing? Like she wasn't bothered by it? 
I asked her why she wasn't bothered by it and she said ""I don't know, he's kind of cute"". And that was the end of it. 

It's been months now. (Can't believe how close 2018 is to ending). But it still bothers me to this day. And sometimes I feel insecure about it.
Should I bring it up to her? Or should I just try to let it go? Any and all advice is appreciated.",,,

That derealization/depersonalization post hits home hard. I‚Äôve been struggling with this for as long as I could remember. You guys know the feeling when you watch a movie? Imagine your brain having this bizarre feeling that your life is not real and you‚Äôre Just living life in a movie. It‚Äôs the worst feeling in the world and fuck it‚Äôs just torture. I literally have times when I zone out into space and forget I‚Äôm even here. I am so inspired by the commenters who were brave enough to comment about this condition, makes me feel a hell of a lot better knowing I‚Äôm not alone. Still though, it‚Äôs hard as hell to study and get by in life when nothing feels like it matters. Hope you guys get through it. It‚Äôd mean a lot to have someone to talk to about this, but I feel creepy messaging random people. I‚Äôve never opened up to anyone about it, not even my SO. I don‚Äôt want to be that ‚Äúweirdo with the mental issues‚Äù or be called a schizo

For me, on the other hand, I used scissors & just slid the blade back & forth on my wrist. The scissors were not sharp & I did bleed, but barely. The scars are very faint & no one notices them. I guess that is why I do not consider it to be self-harm, which I guess is ignorant on my part. I just think that my version of self-harm was not serious, so if I label it as self-harm, it makes it sound worse than it actually was & I think it takes away the meaning from people who self-harm in worse ways than me.

I can report this to the academic integrity office but I would risk losing my friend and ruin this TA's life and get him kicked out of his program, and on the other hand I just worry they won't believe me (since they were mainly international students) and I don't want to be accused of racism.

6377,10/31/2018 5:14:51,"When I was younger, I had a really hard time making friends. I was excluded from almost every social group and didn‚Äôt have a real friend until high school, who was a girl and eventually broke my heart three times. She and my ex-girlfriend teamed up after I broke up with the latter, took literally all my ‚Äúfriends‚Äù away from me, and made the rest of high school a living hell for me. I lost my trust in people. I tried to cope with this by working hard and finding happiness through professional and academic achievements. I always thought that if I worked hard, I could prove myself, get out of that hellhole, and go to a top school, where I could find true happiness with like-minded people. That part happened‚ÄîI made it to UCSD. 

In the beginning of freshman year, I was happy. I had a lot of impressive goals which I wanted to achieve. I went to a lot of office hours, adjunct classes, and professional workshops. I got on the Deans Honors List, which was my biggest goal for first quarter, and was on track to be where I wanted to be. But then I joined an organization on campus (can‚Äôt say because if I do, it will be obvious who I am) winter quarter which just destroyed me. I spent so much time with my teammates and thought they would be the type of friends I have been wanting my entire life. 

I was hopeful. And yet so wrong. 

By the beginning of this quarter, I didn‚Äôt feel the same with them as I did before. They all got along really well, and I again started to feel excluded. Whenever I would put a meme or professional opportunity on our group chat, nobody would respond to it. But they all responded to each other. If they made plans and I wasn‚Äôt there, nobody would ask about me‚Äîbut if someone else was missing, they would wonder where that person is. I started to feel that they don‚Äôt like me or don‚Äôt want me around. The people in the organization low key make fun of me behind my back‚Äîand sometimes right in front of me. There was this one time when we all went out as an organization, and every time I tried to join a group to Uber back to campus, they rejected me. Literally, I would go up to them and try to get the last seat, and then to prevent me from joining, they would go find someone else to get that last seat or even just say that they weren‚Äôt going back to campus, just so I wouldn‚Äôt be with them. It breaks my heart because I invested the entire quarter by sacrificing time, energy, money and grades to be part of that organization, and it doesn‚Äôt seem like it was for me. 
On top of that, as an out-of-state student, I knew that coming here would be expensive, and I had planned it out financially, but it has been an even bigger burden on my family than I previously expected. I can never go out, because I feel guilty spending even more money than my family is already paying. Sad thing is, I have always wanted to go to a concert, sports game, or business conference and never have because every time I look at the price of the tickets, I just think of making my family suffer even more. 

I dealt with this by working hard again and trying to accomplish a lot to make it feel that my sacrifices are worth it. But, I‚Äôm starting to break down and am going to soon hit my tipping point. I‚Äôm failing midterms, even after the curves. This girl who I really like and used to think of as my future wife low key recently rejected me. Whenever I talk with my family over the phone, I try to hide my pain and seem super enthusiastic, so they don‚Äôt have to worry about me and know that I am suffering. They do have an idea that I am going through a rough time right now, but they don‚Äôt know what to do. At night, I cry myself to sleep or pass out due to exhaustion. Whoever I try to talk to doesn‚Äôt really understand what I‚Äôm going through and just gives generic ‚Äúit‚Äôll get better‚Äù advice which ends up being useless. I like to think of myself as an extremely caring, genuine, and reliable person, but I don‚Äôt know how to fix this. 

If you know anyone who might be going through similar situations or who is just having a rough time, you should be a good friend and reach out to them with a simple ‚ÄúHi, what‚Äôs up?‚Äù text. It would go a long way. I wish someone did that to me üôÅ",,,

So, I was gonna get a single, but my parents thought it was too expensive, so I got a double with a randomly assigned roommate. He was a bit awkward at first when I first met him and he didn't talk much. I noticed he had some kind of animal costume in his closet one time and thought it was for Halloween or something. Everything was generally okay up until the point he talked to me about ""furries"" and I thought it was alright, not for me, but do your own thing, you know? After this however, he started wearing it in the dorm while talking to his friends online. I usually have headphones on and our desks are facing away from each other, so it didn't really bother me too much, it was kind of weird though. Anyways, I told him I was gonna have a friend over to do calc homework, so I figured he would take off his fursuit when I went to go down and let my friend in, but when I opened the door, he was standing right in front of it and said something along the lines of, ""Hi X's friend! I'm Y, his fuzzy roommate!"" I was shocked at this display, I saw my friend looking wide eyed, not knowing what to say, so I just said, ""we'll be right back"" and we just went into the study room down the hall and just pretended it never happened. I had no idea how to address it in the first place. After that, I went back to my dorm and told him that it seemed a little much to do that kind of thing in front of strangers and he said okay, but he seemed very sad, so I assumed he got the message. Unfortunately, he did not, and when I told him that a few friends were coming over to watch some videos, there he was again, but this time he was sitting at his chair and just said, ""Hi."" It was an improvement, but he was still wearing his fursuit... I just told my friends it was for some kind of project and shrugged it off.

6410,11/1/2018 0:29:25,"[serious] I wish I liked girls. Throughout my life I've had multiple opportunities to get with someone - the chemistry was there, the attraction from them was there, but I was just incapable of liking them like that. As a result, I'd end up making up some excuse like 'oh i don't believe in high school relationships' which everyone believed. There was this one girl especially, who maybe, in another life, could've been it, you know? We almost went down that road, everything was there, except... that's right. I didn't like her. I couldn't. No matter how hard I tried. I made her my best friend since we're really close anyway, guaranteeing that she would remain an important part of my life, but I always feel like I let her down. I didn't reject her or anything, just stopped pursuing, so technically there wasn't any closure. She doesn't have a bf or anything, never has, and says she isn't trying, even though we always tease each other about it. I just hope she isn't, like, waiting for me. Anyways, back to the main thing. For every girl I've had the potential to be with, I always feel guilty because I feel like I should have liked them. And I'm really disappointed in myself for it. It's probably because I was raised Catholic and in a conservative fam, or that I like to think logically/rationally when it comes to everything, or a combination of both. It blows that I can't logic my way through something like this, and I lost all hope that this could be changed when I went to my priest and he said ""There's nothing you can do about it. As long as you're a good person it doesn't really matter"" which made me feel sad and happy at the same time (He was such a good priest in general tbh; it's a shame he got transferred. thanks for everything, fr. chad). I'm not homophobic to other people - I have friends who aren't straight and I'm overtly neutral on the issue - but I guess I'm homophobic to myself and will try to discredit the feelings I have for other guys. Essentially what I do is always assume every guy I meet is straight and 'bro-zone' them in that way. Which sounds irrational I know, but in my mind I can't rationalize how this is rational so it is really irrational? And the reason I bring this up is now is cause now we're in college and it's happening yet again with a girl I met and I just came to the realization that I'm probably be gonna be doing this whole cycle of thinking I'm finally into this one girl, coming back to reality and facing the fact that I'm in denial, ultimately friendzoning them, then feeling guilty/ashamed afterwards. All while harboring feelings for some other dude I'll never allow myself to be with. It blows. What I'll never do though is fake that I have genuine feelings for someone; the worse thing I can do is lead a girl on and then tell her way too late into the game that I don't root for her team. Point is, I know I'm living a lie but I don't know if I can ever accept this; I'm so deep in the closet I'm practically in Narnia. Haha. P.S. I apologize if this sounds unnecessarily sad, like a 'woe is me' post. I'm not trying to be egocentric; I know people have way worse problems than this.

6474,11/3/2018 17:22:43,"tl;dr version: asking that people ‚Äúaccept‚Äù your gender identity is not the same as asking that people accept gay marriage and lumping these two together as ‚Äúprogressive and on the right side of history‚Äù is just wrong

I will accept that gender and sex are different but if gender is defined by ‚Äúhow we feel‚Äù then it‚Äôs essentially as meaningless as identifying ourselves by our favorite color.  

The problem with people asking that we acknowledge their gender is what makes it different from asking us to accept gay marriage (something that is fine): it‚Äôs that our ‚Äúacceptance‚Äù of their identity asks something of us, that we use their pronouns (contrast this with gay marriage which doesn‚Äôt affect us at all unless you‚Äôre that kind of religious person I guess).  It pushes on us the requirement to address them by the titles they ask for

Sure you can argue that using someone‚Äôs pronouns isn‚Äôt a lot.  However it is asking SOMETHING of us that‚Äôs more than just ‚Äúletting them exist‚Äù, as many of these people claim.  We should be allowed to choose how we want to address them and not be accused of committing a hate crime when we don‚Äôt address them properly.  

In short, asking for ‚Äúacceptance‚Äù (which is the entirely wrong word for it btw.  It‚Äôs like saying ‚ÄúI want to be this thing that I admit is ultimately imaginary, you must call me such and such and if you don‚Äôt you are going against my existence‚Äù) for your gender crosses lines that something like asking for acceptance of gay marriage doesn‚Äôt: specifically it‚Äôs about something unreal (a social construct) vs something real (sexuality) and demands things from us (that we address them as they want) vs asks for ‚Äújust acceptance‚Äù ",,,

I miss you. I miss you so much. We've known each other for so long and I know a lot of time has gone by, you have a new life here and yet I miss you with the same intensity I did the day after we separated. I've dated other guys and you gave me such a big problem, because I always seem to end up comparing them to what you were with me.

6476,11/3/2018 18:30:01,"*Old man rant incoming* One thing that really pisses me off about our generation is the lack of actually keeping appointments and doing things. Whether it be with friends or potential partners, everyone is scared shit that a better option is going to come around so they choose ""maybe"". Or ""interested"". I get sometimes there are uncertainties but I'm just tired of people using excuses like this to, in a way, waste people's time. Example: I'll ask my friends, ""Hey you want to see a movie this weekend?"". They'll say maybe. I'll make time in my schedule and pester them with details about tickets etc. all for them to say ""Oops nevermind I'm busy with <Insert excuse to go to stay home and watch netflix> so I can't make it"". Or they don't reply until the next day saying ""Sorry something came up"". In the world of dating it's even worse since this problem we have makes the concept of a planned ""date"" a complete pipedream. God knows how many people I've clicked with in class or something and after a bit of chemistry and a good conversation or two, I'll ask them out for something light-usually coffee. This almost always causes them to either a) start the whole ""too busy"" train which eventually leads to ghosting/ avoiding me or, b) making plans and actually standing me up. And then they reply to my ""wtf"" texts 2 weeks later saying they found someone else. On dating apps, it's even more apparent as the prospect of a ""better option"" is so much easier to come by that there's no reason to even try and plan anything. Might as well just wait for a cuter person to come swipe by and not make any commitments to get a free coffee-ugh wouldn't want to waste my time being a decent human being!

I have a ton of friends who are single and are attracted to other women and would genuinely like to be in a relationship with them. I also know that these people are great and would make good significant others. But most of them lack the balls to do anything about it. I tell them if you like someone ... just ask them out. And they're like - no I cant. What if I get rejected. That's so humiliating. What if they have a boyfriend. But I don't see what's the problem with asking someone out or why they are so afraid to do it. All it takes is going up to who you like and saying - Hey. I've talked to you a few times, and I think you're a really cool person. Could I take you out to coffee so I can get to know you better. THATS IT! Worst case scenario - they turn you down because they are in a relationship or whatever. Good - you don't spend any more time thinking about them and can go on finding other people who might be good for you. Best case scenario - they say yes and you guys kick it off and end up being in a happy relationship. GROW A PAIR PEOPLE AND TAKE CHANCES...

I just don't understand the need for people to make that concept fluid when we already have gender fluidity. It seems trivial and unnecessary since by definition and practice-gender outclasses sex. If you believe that you are a certain gender (And thus perceived sex) on the spectrum it doesn't really matter how many chromosomes or what body parts you have-you are what you are. Perhaps sexual fluidity is a way of differentiating perceptual gender (What I think my sex is) from societal gender, but even then I don't really see a need for trying to mess with biology when you already have it your way. Fuck that society thinks something different than you do-it's the same thing. Is this all due to intersex people-people born with actual sexual deformities that inhibit them form being classically being labeled as male or female at all-existing? But even then, because their gender is fluid they don't have to be either a male or a female-they can just being whatever they want. I just think, and I know this is a super unpopular opinion, but we need to use sex as some kind of determinant-at least for research, medical, etc. purposes. It means nothing about you and you can use whatever you want to describe and express yourself-why not keep your microscopic profile out of it? It doesn't mean anything if you have a fluid perception of your sex. If you're offended by what's inside you're chromosomes despite having pure control of who you are sexually in every way, then freedom has no meaning to you.

I'm sorry if this is long, but I finally I just got out of such a toxic relationship that lasted about a year & four months. And honestly, despite how down I feel, I am so glad I was finally about to break up with him. I don't want to be corny, but I feel free. Like I can finally control my life. I'm embarrassed to say that I dedicated so much of my time and being to him that now that I'm without him, I don't really know who I am. I completely lost myself in a relationship that was only pushing me farther down into my depression. It took me so long to break up with him because I was always so scared of him carrying out his promise of killing himself if we ever broke up. And I know that I shouldn't feel responsible if anything happens, but I can't help it. Despite all the shit I was put through, I still love him and don't want anything to happen to him. I know he wasn't good for me or my mental health, but now I just don't know what to do or how to navigate myself now. But oh well, that's life.

That is fine too, but he was the one who was really into this and pushing both of us( in a good way) and now...he seems pushed back.

6627,11/7/2018 23:18:09,"OP from #6508 @Kyle Pineda
Are you serious dude? Obviously the ones with straight abuse should break up with the other person, I was referring to posts such as:

#5008 OP [girlfriend] has sweaty hands and boyfriend doesn't like that, comment from Yulia saying to break up with him. 31 people including you liked her comment. Really? Break up over something that petty with no other context? For all we know they could have a stable relationship but this one gripe OP has with her SO was something she wanted addressed. You're out here thinking he doesn't love her and give her any other affection because he doesn't want to hold a sweaty hand.

#6201 OP talks about boyfriend being a hoe at raves, and although I do agree this definitely steps boundaries, a lot of people are just inherently oblivious in the spur of the moment, not everyone acts out of malice and selfishness like you'd perceive them to be. Everyone has different boundaries and concluding that the act is exclusively malicious makes no sense.

In these situations direct communication can do A LOT when talking to a partner in the way that the person wrote the confession did. A lot of the time people won't confront their SO directly and instead go seek advice in a place like this when they could've skipped all the corners and talk about the problems in the relationship directly, and if the boyfriend/girlfriend didn't want to/doesn't show any signs of improving, leaving the relationship to focus on yourself or find someone who treats you the way you want to be treated is the obvious answer. But jumping the gun and telling people to break up with their SO because of something that can potentially be fixed by proper communication is really asinine thinking.",,,
6628,11/8/2018 5:07:42,"Attraction is a two-way street. No matter how many times you try, you can't change how someone feels about you. If the person you like likes someone else, then that's that. No one is expected to reciprocate anything in return unless they have feelings for you as well.

This is the reason why I think the ""friendzone"" doesn't exist, it's just a coping mechanism made up by those who refuse to believe they were rejected. This is why ""niceguys/nicegirls"" and all the messy variants exist. Just keep trying, man, it hurts to move on but you gotta do what you gotta do.

Besides, if they didn't have feelings for you in the first place, are you really compatible with them, or are you just infatuated with them?

Sex works the same way. Don't continue to creep on or pressure someone who clearly isn't interested in doing it with you, just find someone else willing to.

Anyways, I was already struggling with isolation and emptiness, but after some events that recently occurred, my trust in people has decreased to its lowest point since I was young.

6707,11/10/2018 11:25:06,"So I'm a really lucky man with an absolutely gorgeous queen of a girlfriend. When we're cuddling or just getting more intimate, I get super turned on my just holding her in my arms, touching her all over, and running my hands around he body. However over the entire time we've been going out, my gf has put on quite a bit of relationship weight. Now I'm 100% fine with this as I love her regardless-but as I mentioned, I'm just a really touchy guy so I actually enjoy touching and caressing her newly-formed stomach rolls and her fluffier ass. However whenever I just caress her belly or butt in any way now, she completely turns off and begins thinking I don't love her anymore/ is just embarrassed by her fat. But it's only when we get intimate-she's completely fine being overweight (And is big into the whole fat-acceptance movement) in every other sense so it's even more baffling. Anyway we're a bit at odds right now though since even though she told me not to touch her belly, it's kinda hard not to when cuddling or having sex. Last night we were cuddling while watching a movie and my hand just naturally moved to her midsection (She's short and was pretty much lying on top me so it was tough not to) and I barely even moved my fingers before she got up and started a fight which ended with her storming out of my apartment. Once again, I have no problem with her and will support and love her at whatever weight she wants to be at, but I feel she also has to accept herself intimately or she can't be in a relationship with someone who wants nothing more than to love her. I don't know what more to tell her.",,,

I've essentially been their maid this entire semester and the second I ask for help around the house they say I'm ""expecting too much"" of them.

I am a fan of nintendo and really only like the main games for mario, pokemon and loz, so i feel like if i wanted to get into smash i'd just immediately want a ""higher tier"" fighter, but then i would have to use a character from another series that i have little to no nostolgia for/relation to whatsoever. Also I've never played smash before so i'm kind of overwhelmed with all the hype and the different playstyles and movesets...etc. 

Im curious how long it took yall to get used to playing it, or if there were any games you played before that made you want to play smash...because at this point I dont feel like fighting games are up my alley, and i dont want to drop 60$ on something i'm not going to enjoy playing. I tried watching videos of fighter analysis and of competitions, but i dont feel engaged in the same way as if im watching playthroughs of rpgs.

So I personally don't care either way about immigration, but I can understand where you're coming from. I had a conversation with an advisor at my school, that went along the lines of ""I deal with international students all the time and I see the struggle of just getting all the documents to be here to go to school, and we have all these government acts to help illegal immigrants and no grace for people who come here legally. I don't see how this is fair at all."" ",,,

6792,11/12/2018 9:06:59,"About the argument on that post we all have seen recently:

I kind of agree with Yulia about the post giving off, I guess, pretentious vibes about the whole matter, or in Yulia words, op acting as if he ""found the mf grail,"" but I also feel she overestimates the general public's knowledge on Japan's involvement in WWII. From personal experience, I only was taught of Japan committing war crimes in high school, nothing more than that. Mind you that I am a POC from a predominantly white neighborhood, so my little anecdotes definitely may not be applicable to everyone else's experience, but if many others can relate to this than that says more about our education system than anything else. It wasn't until I entered into college that I found out about the extent of Japan's atrocities in the war; and looking back I feel that most of my education on WWII focused mainly on Europe and the Holocaust rather than other countries look those in Asia. Again, my own personal experience is my own and doesn't represent everyone's. So I think for the most part, and I can very much be wrong in making this claim, that mostly everyone knows of Japan's involvement and the crimes they committed during WWII, but don't truly understand the extent of it, some of the specific crimes they committed.

As for Jorge, I do agree that he has more of a say in the matter about the Latino community being oblivious to the extent of Japan's war crimes. I'm not Latino, but I've had my own fair share of people who aren't Chinese trying to tell me my own cultural community's background and struggles. Of course Jorge and I aren't the sole representatives of our respective cultures, but our own personal experiences along with many others in our communities can say a lot about how our community educates itself with other cultures' histories; it says a lot about how our communities interact with others and help each other through sharing information and communication. So for the most part, I do think Jorge has slightly more validity in explaining his own community's education of Japan's atrocities, but that's just my two cents there.

Anyways, the takeaway message, and this is just my own personal rambling, is that most of the general public knows of Japan's war crimes, but not the specifics of them nor the extent of them. More importantly, OP actually gained something from their experience traveling abroad, and trying to prove who is more entitled or valid in representing a claim on the general public's education is not only petty, but also futile. If the general public truly does not know about Japan's atrocities, than that says more on our education system and that should be the focus of our attention, not on who's more valid. Moreover, focus on OP learning about something and hopefully, if they are truly passionate about changing what they saw, OP takes steps to educate others around them about Japan's history in WWII.",,[serious],
6793,11/12/2018 10:34:48,"Jorge, learn to take a fall and shut the fuck up. As a Latino, you don't speak for all of us and represent us. If you really knew about the Latin American community, you'd know that it is one of the most diverse heterogenous communities and to generalize even a single Latin American community on your OWN ANECDOTAL experiences is foolish. Your general mentality is toxic and I strongly believe you have some serious anger issues. 
tl;dr Jorge, as you would say, FOH with your opinions (Opinions aren't truth).",,[serious],
